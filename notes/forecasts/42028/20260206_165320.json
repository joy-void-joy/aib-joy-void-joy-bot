  "summary": "The Gorton and Denton by-election (Feb 26, 2026) is a three-way race between Greens, Reform UK, and Labour. Betting markets strongly favor the Green Party (~50% implied from Betfair 1.88 odds), with Reform second (~33% at 3.0) and Labour third (~16% at 6.4). Labour damaged their chances by blocking popular Andy Burnham from standing, combined with historic national unpopularity. In a three-way race, the Greens benefit from vote splitting between Labour and Reform. Some polls show Reform leading in raw vote share (30%), but the Greens' strong local organization and momentum in betting markets make them the frontrunner.",
