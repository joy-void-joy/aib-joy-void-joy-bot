  "summary": "Forecasting the ICE BofA US High Yield Index Total Return Value on 2026-02-13, approximately 11 trading days from the last known value of 1876.28 (Jan 29). The forecast centers near current levels with modest positive drift from carry (~6% annual yield), but with slightly asymmetric downside risk due to historically tight credit spreads (2.7% vs 4.9% 20-year average). The Fed held rates at 3.5-3.75% in January and is expected to remain on hold through March, providing a stable rate environment. Economic growth remains solid. The distribution reflects typical high yield volatility (~5-6% annualized) over the short horizon, with a mixture model accounting for 80% normal conditions, 15% mild stress, and 5% significant stress scenarios.",
