  "summary": "SMCI's Q2 FY2026 earnings release on Feb 3 (after market close) is the dominant catalyst for this 8-trading-day comparison. The stock has missed earnings in 5 of 8 recent quarters (62.5%), suggesting elevated risk of disappointment. However, the stock is already beaten down ~45% in 3 months, trading near 52-week lows at a technical support zone ($28-30), meaning negative surprises may be partially priced in. Options markets imply ~12% move either direction. The conflicting signals - poor recent track record vs oversold conditions - suggest near-50% probability, with slight tilt toward NO based on the miss history.",
