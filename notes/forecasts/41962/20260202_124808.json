  "summary": "The Nikkei 225 is currently near 54,000, close to record highs. Japan's snap election on Feb 8 (5 days before resolution) is the major catalyst. PM Takaichi's 78% approval and polls suggesting LDP landslide support continued market strength, but risks remain (LDP party approval only 30%, precedent of 2024 election upset). Using the Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (34.33) to calibrate uncertainty and scenario-weighted Monte Carlo simulation, I forecast a median around 54,500 with left-skewed distribution reflecting election upset tail risk. The 80% confidence interval spans roughly 51,500 to 57,400.",
