  "summary": "The 3-month Treasury yield (DGS3MO) should remain highly stable around current levels of 3.66-3.67% given: (1) Fed just held rates at 3.50-3.75% on Jan 28; (2) no FOMC meeting until March 17-18; (3) 3-month yields are tightly anchored to Fed policy. The yield varied only 4 basis points (3.66-3.70%) over the past week. The Feb 6 jobs report could cause minor movement, but short-term rates are largely set until the next Fed meeting. My distribution is centered at ~3.66% with modest uncertainty bands appropriate for this stable, anchored financial instrument.",
