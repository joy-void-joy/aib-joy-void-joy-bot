  "summary": "This meta-prediction asks whether the Metaculus CP for Sudan ceasefire will rise above exactly 31.00% by Feb 15. The CP has been stable at 31% for ~2 weeks despite ongoing news, supported by a large forecaster base (708) that creates inertia. Recent news is uniformly negative for ceasefire: SAF is making major military gains (broke Dilling siege, killed key RSF figure), Egypt is directly supporting SAF with drone strikes, RSF rejected the government's ceasefire proposal, and fighting is intensifying across Kordofan and Darfur. With SAF winning militarily, they have little incentive to negotiate. The only potential positive catalyst is the UN ministerial-level briefing in February, but this is unlikely to produce breakthrough news. Status quo favors CP staying at or below 31%.",
