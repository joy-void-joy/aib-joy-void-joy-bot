  "summary": "The CP is currently at 7.8%, below the 8.00% threshold, having drifted down from 8.00% on Feb 1. Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as successor on Jan 30 signals a \"wait for term to expire\" strategy rather than a firing attempt, which has likely contributed to the downward drift. While Manifold is higher at 13.1% and the gap is small (0.2pp), the recent downward trend, lack of near-term catalyst, and 208 forecasters providing stability suggest CP is more likely to stay at or below 8% than rise above it.",
