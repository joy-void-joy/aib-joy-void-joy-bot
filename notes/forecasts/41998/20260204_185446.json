  "summary": "This meta-prediction asks whether the Metaculus CP for \"Will Netanyahu cease to be PM in 2026?\" will exceed 30% on Feb 11. The CP is currently at 26% (down from 30% at launch on Feb 1), meaning it needs to gain 4+ percentage points in 7 days. With 787 forecasters creating significant inertia and a recent downward trend, this reversal seems unlikely without a major catalyst. The gap between Manifold markets (39-44%) and Metaculus (26%) creates some upward pressure, but this gap has existed while CP dropped. Phase 2 ceasefire negotiations starting Feb 4 could generate news that stresses Netanyahu's coalition, but even coalition tensions don't guarantee a CP swing of this magnitude in one week.",
