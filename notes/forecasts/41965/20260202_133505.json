  "summary": "Google Trends interest in \"government shutdown 2026\" is currently elevated because we're IN an active partial shutdown (started Jan 30-31, 2026). The shutdown is expected to resolve by Feb 4 when the House passes funding. However, DHS funding expires on Feb 13, creating another deadline just one day after the measurement date (Feb 12). The key dynamic is that Feb 2 captures peak shutdown interest while Feb 12 will capture pre-deadline interest. Being in an active shutdown typically generates more searches than approaching a deadline, favoring \"Decreases.\" But the tight \u00b13 point threshold makes \"Doesn't change\" quite plausible if both dates have similarly elevated interest around their respective events.",
