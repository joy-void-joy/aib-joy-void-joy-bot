  "summary": "Google Trends interest in \"opm\" spiked to 100 on Jan 26 during the government shutdown, which ended Feb 4. The question compares Feb 4 (Wednesday, ~15) to Feb 15 (Sunday). Historical data shows weekend values average ~6 points lower than weekdays, exceeding the \u00b13 threshold. However, the DHS funding deadline on Feb 13 creates uncertainty - another shutdown or crisis could spike interest. DECREASE is most likely due to the weekend effect and post-shutdown decay, but INCREASE has meaningful probability if DHS negotiations fail.",
