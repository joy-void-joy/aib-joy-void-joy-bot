  "summary": "This is a 9-trading-day directional stock forecast. WDAY is in a strong downtrend (-34% over 52 weeks) and near its 52-week low ($169.01 vs current ~$173). Base statistical probability for any stock being up over 9 days is ~52%, but momentum effects favor continuation of the decline. No earnings or major catalysts fall within the Feb 2-15 window (earnings expected Feb 24-Mar 2). Analyst consensus remains bullish (Buy with $279 target) which could attract value buyers near the low. Overall, the downtrend momentum slightly outweighs the potential for mean reversion or support bounce, yielding a probability just below 50%.",
