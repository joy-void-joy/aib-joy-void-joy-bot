  "summary": "This meta-prediction hinges on whether the CP for the DOJ Public Integrity Section question will drift above 47% in the next 10 days. The current CP is exactly at threshold. The news environment favors upward drift: the section has been gutted, related provisions suspended, and DOJ is actively revising policy. However, with 114 forecasters and no immediate catalyst expected, the CP has moderate stability. Since any upward move resolves YES and the policy momentum clearly trends toward eventual removal, I estimate 55% probability that CP exceeds 47% by Feb 15.",
