  "summary": "The US scored 65 on the 2024 CPI (record low since 2012 methodology). The 2025 CPI, releasing Feb 10, 2026, will capture major 2025 developments including FCPA enforcement pause, ethics requirement rescissions, and documented conflicts of interest. Historical max single-year decline is 4 points. I forecast median ~61 (4-point decline matching historical max), with uncertainty allowing 57-65. The Manifold market showing 74% probability of 2026 being lower than 2025 supports continued decline expectations. Distribution is asymmetric, weighted toward larger declines given unprecedented policy environment.",
