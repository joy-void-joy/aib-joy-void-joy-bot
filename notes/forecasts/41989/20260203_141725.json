  "summary": "Thom Tillis has been in an active news cycle since Jan 27-30 (Noem resignation call, Warsh opposition), with baseline value of 24 on Feb 1. Most likely outcome is \"Decreases\" as typical news cycle decay takes hold - we're 2+ weeks from peak by Feb 10 with no scheduled hearings or events in the window. \"Doesn't change\" is possible if decay is gradual within \u00b13 threshold. \"Increases\" requires significant new developments but is plausible given ongoing Warsh confirmation fight and Tillis's continued provocative statements.",
