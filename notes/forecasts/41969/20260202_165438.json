  "summary": "ALGN has Q4 2025 earnings on Feb 4 after market close - the key catalyst between comparison dates. With a track record of beating earnings (3 of 4 quarters), positive analyst sentiment (Buy ratings, $175-200 targets), and leading indicators suggesting strong Q4 case shipments, there's a modest positive bias. However, the stock is down 28% YoY and guidance uncertainty remains. Net assessment: slight edge toward YES given earnings history and analyst sentiment, but not strong conviction.",
