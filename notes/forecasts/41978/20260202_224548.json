  "summary": "The search term \"uf\" primarily refers to the University of Florida. The Florida Gators are the defending 2025 NCAA basketball national champions, currently ranked #19 and leading the SEC. Key to this forecast: there's a basketball game on Feb 10 (at Georgia) but no major event on Feb 2 (the comparison date). This asymmetry suggests slight upward pressure on interest by Feb 10. However, regular season basketball games typically don't cause dramatic search spikes, and the \u00b13 threshold allows for substantial normal variation. I assign moderate probability to \"Doesn't change\" (45%) as the most likely outcome, with \"Increases\" (30%) slightly more likely than \"Decreases\" (25%) due to the game day effect on Feb 10.",
