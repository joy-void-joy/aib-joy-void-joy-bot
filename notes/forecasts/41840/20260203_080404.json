  "summary": "Australia's February 2026 unemployment rate should remain close to current levels. December 2025 was 4.1%, February 2025 was also 4.1%, and the RBA notes unemployment has been \"broadly stable at around 4\u00bc%\" in recent quarters. While forecasts expect gradual rises to 4.4-4.5% by mid-2026, February is too early for significant drift. Month-to-month volatility is typically 0.0-0.2pp. Central estimate ~4.15%, with distribution slightly right-skewed reflecting expected gradual increase over the year.",
