  "summary": "The question asks for the percentage change in global ground transportation CO2 emissions from 2020 to 2025, resolved by Carbon Monitor. 2020 was a COVID-induced low point (~15% below 2019). Recovery has been strong: Carbon Monitor data shows +8.8% (2020\u21922021) and +2.5% (2021\u21922022). IEA data indicates transport emissions nearly returned to 2019 levels by 2024, with 2025 expected to be the peak year before EV-driven decline. Compounding the documented growth rates with estimated 2023-2025 growth yields a central estimate of ~+17%. Uncertainty stems from final 2025 data not yet published and potential methodological variations in Carbon Monitor's calculation.",
