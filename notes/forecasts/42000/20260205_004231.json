  "summary": "Amy Klobuchar's Google Trends interest spiked to 93 on Jan 29 when she announced her Minnesota governor run, but has since decayed to ~9 (Feb 4). Values appear stabilized at this elevated baseline. No major campaign events are scheduled for Feb 5-12 (caucuses were Feb 3, conventions are in March). The \u00b13 threshold is tight relative to typical day-to-day volatility at low values. \"Doesn't change\" is favored as the status quo, but her active governor campaign and the ongoing Minnesota immigration story create meaningful upside potential. Limited downside given values are already near baseline (floor around 5-6).",
