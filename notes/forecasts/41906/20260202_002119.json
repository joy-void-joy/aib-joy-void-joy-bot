  "summary": "The Trump administration has already taken multiple formal actions since October 2025 that appear to qualify as \"another process\" to reduce NYC funding. Most significantly: (1) NYC is explicitly named as \"New York City, NY\" on the DOJ's sanctuary jurisdiction list under EO 14287 - a documented formal government action specifically targeting NYC; (2) The HHS funding freeze (January 5-6, 2026) placed New York state on \"restricted drawdown\" for TANF, CCDF, and SSBG programs totaling over $10 billion - while targeting the state, these funds flow directly to NYC services. The main uncertainty is definitional: whether state-level actions affecting NYC-bound funds satisfy \"specifically allocated to New York City.\" Given that NYC is explicitly named in sanctuary actions, the strong pattern of formal government actions, and 3 months remaining for additional actions under the escalating conflict with Mayor Mamdani, resolution to YES is highly likely.",
