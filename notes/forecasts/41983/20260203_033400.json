  "summary": "ServiceNow (NOW) is caught between strong fundamentals and severe sector headwinds. Q4 earnings beat expectations but the stock fell anyway, and SaaS stocks broadly are in a sharp selloff (IGV down 16% in January) on AI disruption fears. The stock is near its 52-week low, which could trigger a technical bounce, and the $5B buyback authorization provides some support. However, after-hours trading is already down, momentum is clearly negative, and the sector narrative remains bearish. With 7 trading days and no catalysts, this is close to a coin flip with a slight bearish tilt.",
