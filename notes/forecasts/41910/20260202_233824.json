  "summary": "Namibia's March 2026 annual inflation is forecast to be around 3.4%, with significant uncertainty. Key factors: (1) December 2025 inflation at 3.2% (lowest in 2025), (2) favorable base effect from elevated March 2025 (4.2%), (3) Bank of Namibia forecasts 3.8-4.3% average for 2026, (4) South Africa inflation expected ~3% (currency peg). The base effect from high March 2025 will compress YoY rates, but modest uptick expected through 2026. Distribution is slightly right-skewed for supply shock risks.",
