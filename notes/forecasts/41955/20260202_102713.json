  "summary": "The community prediction is currently at 28%, already 2 percentage points above the 26% threshold. The CP has shown a clear upward trend (24% \u2192 28%) over the past two weeks, and the large forecaster base (770) creates stability. While Manifold's more skeptical 17% estimate could exert some downward pressure, the current buffer and positive momentum suggest the CP is likely to remain above 26% on February 15. The main risk is random fluctuation given the relatively close threshold.",
