  "summary": "VRSN reports Q4 2025 earnings on February 5, 2026 - directly within the forecasting window between Feb 3 and Feb 11 close. This earnings event dominates the forecast. Analyst expectations are for EPS $2.28 (slight beat typical). However, Q3 2025 showed a pattern where VeriSign beat expectations but the stock still traded DOWN on underlying domain growth concerns. The stock is currently ~20% below its July 2025 high of $305-310, suggesting lingering negative sentiment. With the key catalyst being an uncertain earnings reaction, and historical precedent showing beats don't guarantee positive price action, this is essentially a coin flip with slight negative bias from recent patterns.",
