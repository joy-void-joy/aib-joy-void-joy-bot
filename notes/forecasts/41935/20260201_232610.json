  "summary": "The Melania documentary currently has a 10% Rotten Tomatoes score (2 Fresh / 20 reviews) with overwhelmingly negative critical consensus (Metacritic 7/100). Monte Carlo simulation modeling additional reviews suggests the score will likely drift slightly lower as more negative reviews come in, though it could stay around 10% if few new reviews appear. The Manifold market corroborates expectations of a very low final score (87% probability below 20%). My forecast centers around 8-10% with high confidence the score will remain in single digits to low teens.",
