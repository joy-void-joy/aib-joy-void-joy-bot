  "summary": "The 6-month Treasury yield (DGS6MO) is currently at 3.62% and closely anchored to the Fed funds rate (3.50-3.75%). With no FOMC meeting before resolution and high recent stability (3.61-3.63% range), the yield should stay near current levels. The jobs report on Feb 6 is the main catalyst that could move yields 5-15 bps. Strong ISM data provides slight upward bias, but recent labor market weakness creates asymmetric downside risk. Distribution centered at 3.62% with moderate uncertainty reflecting the jobs report and general market noise over 6 trading days.",
