  "summary": "Forecasting EM HY corporate credit spread 10 days out from current 3.26%. The spread has been remarkably stable (3.24-3.26%) over the past week. Short time horizon strongly favors stability near current levels. Key risks include tariff uncertainty, but the \"TACO\" phenomenon (Trump Always Chickens Out) has limited market impact. EM credit outlook is constructive with favorable fundamentals and technicals. Applied slight widening bias for asymmetric risk and mean reversion from near-cyclical-lows. Monte Carlo and scenario analysis suggest median around 3.26% with wider upside tail for potential risk-off events.",
