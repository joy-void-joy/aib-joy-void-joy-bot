  "summary": "Meta-prediction about whether Metaculus CP rises above 26% by Feb 11. Current CP is 25% (dropped from 26%), with 745 forecasters creating a stable median. No retirement news expected, and both Thomas/Alito have hired full clerk complements signaling they plan to stay. While Manifold is higher at 41%, 8 days is too short for significant convergence. The recent downward trend and large forecaster base make crossing the 26% threshold unlikely.",
