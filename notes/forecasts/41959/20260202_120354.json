  "summary": "Interest in \"Laken Riley\" is most likely to decrease from Feb 2 to Feb 15, 2026. The Jan 29-31 events (Act anniversary and Ibarra's new trial hearing) likely elevated interest at the start of the window. With no scheduled events until the Feb 22 death anniversary (after resolution), interest should decay. However, the ±3 point threshold makes \"Doesn't change\" plausible if decay is modest. \"Increases\" unlikely without unexpected news, as the judge's ruling isn't expected until after March 2.",
