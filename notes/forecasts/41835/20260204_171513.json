  "summary": "This is a definitional question about a past event. Today is February 4, 2026. Multiple credible sources confirm that the US government entered a partial shutdown at midnight on January 31, 2026 (before February 1, 2026), and this shutdown resulted in furloughs of federal employees - more than 10,000 FAA workers and approximately 8,000 State Department employees. The shutdown lasted four days until the House voted 217-214 on February 3 to end it. All resolution criteria are clearly met. The small residual uncertainty accounts for potential edge cases in resolution interpretation or question annulment.",
