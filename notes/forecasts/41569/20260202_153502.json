  "summary": "The S&P 500 closed at 6,939.03 on January 30, 2026, after a positive January (+1.4%). With 42 days until resolution on March 13, 2026, I expect modest upward drift in line with historical averages, centered around 7,010. Key positive factors include the January Barometer signal and strong earnings beat rates. Key risks include elevated valuations (equity risk premium near zero), AI/tech bubble concerns, and Fed Chair transition uncertainty. Monte Carlo mixture model with 18% volatility and scenario weighting (70% base, 18% bullish, 12% correction) produces these percentile estimates.",
