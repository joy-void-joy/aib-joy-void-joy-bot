Hawkish signals from Kevin Warsh nomination and strong manufacturing data provide slight upward pressure, but the short 7-day horizon limits expected movement. Jobs report on Feb 7 is the main uncertainty. Distribution centered at 3.62% with ~12 bps standard deviation using fat tails for robustness.",
