  "summary": "Despite unprecedented diplomatic activity in January 2026\u2014including first-ever trilateral talks, US envoy meetings with Putin, and European security commitments\u2014Russia publicly rejected key terms just 2 days ago. Foreign Minister Lavrov dismissed Ukraine's security demands and reiterated that the current Ukrainian government must go. Putin continues demanding maximalist positions (full territorial control, no Western troops) that Ukraine cannot accept. The structural incompatibility remains: Russia insists on comprehensive settlement before any ceasefire, while Ukraine needs the ceasefire first. Market consensus (Polymarket 13% for March 31, 27% for June 30) suggests ~18% for May 1. With only 3 months remaining and fundamental positions unchanged, a ceasefire by May 1 requires a dramatic breakthrough that appears unlikely given Russia's recent explicit rejection.",
