  "summary": "Interest in \"luigi mangione\" likely peaked around Jan 30 (death penalty ruling) and will decay by Feb 15. The Feb 6 unexpected court hearing may cause a temporary spike, but appears to be procedural (scheduling). Natural decay from the Jan 30 news spike should dominate, leading to lower interest by Feb 15 than on Feb 2. However, the unknown reason for the Feb 6 hearing adds meaningful uncertainty.",
