  "summary": "This is a meta-prediction asking whether the Metaculus community prediction will be above 46.00% on Feb 12. The current CP appears to be ~50% (per API), already 4 percentage points above the threshold. With 866 forecasters creating a stable base and only ~9 days remaining, a drop back to 46% or below is unlikely without major news. Key context: AI songs have charted on niche Billboard charts but NOT the Hot 100 (Billboard blocked \"I Run\" in Nov 2025). Manifold prices the underlying question at ~36%, suggesting possible Metaculus overestimation, but for meta-predictions what matters is forecaster behavior, not truth. The recent trend has been upward (46%\u219250% in 2 days), and large forecaster bases are sticky. The main risk is negative news about AI music or Billboard policy that causes a rapid sentiment shift.",
