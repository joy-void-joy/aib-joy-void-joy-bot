  "summary": "Sinners holds the all-time record with 16 Oscar nominations but is NOT the Best Picture frontrunner. \"One Battle After Another\" is favored by ~97% of Gold Derby experts. Historical precedent (La La Land: 14 nominations → 6 wins without BP) and category-by-category analysis suggests 4-5 wins is most likely. Sinners is strong in Score (Ludwig Göransson), Casting (new category), and Cinematography, but faces tough competition in acting categories and from Frankenstein in makeup/costume. Monte Carlo simulation accounting for correlated outcomes yields a median of 5 wins, with upside to 8-10 if Sinners wins Best Picture (30% probability) and downside to 1-2 if it significantly underperforms.",
