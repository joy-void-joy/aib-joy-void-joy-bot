  "summary": "The community prediction has already moved from 34% to 35% since Feb 1, crossing the threshold. The question is now whether it will drop back to \u226434% over 13 days. Given ongoing political turmoil around Starmer (leadership challenge speculation, -49 approval, multiple challengers positioning), continued negative news coverage, and Manifold Markets pricing the underlying event higher at 40-42%, I assess there's approximately 72% probability the CP remains above 34%. The main risk is normal prediction volatility causing a 1+ point fluctuation downward.",
