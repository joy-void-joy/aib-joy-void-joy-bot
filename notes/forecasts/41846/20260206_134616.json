  "summary": "The question asks about a successful coup in Africa or Latin America between November 28, 2025 and March 1, 2026. Key finding: Despite high recent coup activity, the Guinea-Bissau coup (Nov 26, 2025) and Madagascar coup (Oct 14, 2025) both occurred BEFORE the resolution window started. Within the window, two attempts failed (Benin Dec 7, Burkina Faso Jan 3), and the Venezuela U.S. intervention (Jan 3) is not a coup under the definition. With ~75% of the 93-day window elapsed and no qualifying successful coup, probability has declined significantly from the base rate of ~40-50% for a 3-month period. The community prediction at 53% appears high given time elapsed; I estimate ~30%.",
