  "summary": "Boeing (BA) faces a 10-day comparison window with several positive catalysts: the Singapore Airshow running Feb 3-8 (Air Cambodia order announced, potential for more), strong Q4 earnings momentum, and bullish analyst consensus with raised price targets. However, much of this good news appears priced in (stock up 7.7% YTD), and short-term stock movements are dominated by random walk dynamics. The 777X engine seal issue adds minor uncertainty. Base rate for stocks rising over 8 trading days is ~52-53%, adjusted slightly upward given near-term catalysts. Final estimate: 55% probability that BA closes higher on Feb 13 than Feb 3.",
