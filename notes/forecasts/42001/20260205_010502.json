  "summary": "Google Trends interest in \"ilhan omar net worth\" spiked to 100 on Jan 28 following a town hall attack and has decayed to ~9 by Feb 4. The key question is whether interest stabilizes (Doesn't change), mean-reverts upward or sees new news (Increases), or continues declining below threshold (Decreases). With current value at 9, the historical floor at 7, and potential for DOJ investigation news, \"Doesn't change\" is most likely but \"Increases\" has meaningful probability due to mean reversion pressure and news risk. \"Decreases\" is least likely as it would require going below the historical floor.",
