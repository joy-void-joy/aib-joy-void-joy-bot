  "summary": "Over a ~10 trading day horizon (Feb 2 to Feb 13/15), stock price movements are largely random with slight positive drift. BAC has strong fundamentals (beat Q4 estimates) but faces headwinds from the credit card rate cap proposal that has made financials the worst S&P sector in 2026. All known information (analyst targets, earnings) is already priced in. The base rate for a large-cap stock being higher over ~2 weeks is approximately 52-53%. With offsetting positive and negative factors, this resolves to essentially a coin flip with slight positive drift.",
