  "summary": "The Euro HY OAS currently stands at 2.64% (Jan 31, 2026), near historical tights. Over the ~8 trading days to resolution (Feb 12), I expect the spread to remain near current levels with slight positive skew reflecting asymmetric risk: limited room for further compression at tights, but tail risk for widening from geopolitical shocks or risk-off events. The ECB meets Feb 4-5 but is expected to hold rates (~90% probability). The distribution is right-skewed with median around 2.67% and fat tails for potential widening scenarios.",
