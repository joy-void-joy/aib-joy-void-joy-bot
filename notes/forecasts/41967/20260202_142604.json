  "summary": "Short-horizon forecast for the Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index (DTWEXBGS) on Feb 10, 2026. Last known value was 119.2855 on Jan 23. Based on historical daily volatility (~0.295% daily std), recent downward trend, and news about January dollar weakness partially offset by a Feb 1 bounce following the Warsh Fed nomination, I estimate a median around 119.0 with moderate uncertainty. Applied 1.4x widening factor for tail risks and the 7-day data gap since last observation.",
