  "summary": "This is a short-term stock price comparison question with ~8 trading days horizon. The base rate is approximately 50% (random walk). RCL recently reported earnings on Jan 29, spiking 18% before pulling back. Analyst sentiment is strongly positive with price targets above current levels, and 2026 guidance exceeded expectations. However, the good news may already be priced in after the post-earnings spike. Small positive tilt due to favorable sentiment, but staying close to the 50% base rate given the short time horizon and high volatility.",
