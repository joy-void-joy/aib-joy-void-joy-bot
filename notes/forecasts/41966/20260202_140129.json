  "summary": "AAPL's short-term price movement over ~10 trading days is close to a coin flip. The base rate for a stock increasing over this period is ~52% due to positive market drift. However, AAPL has negative momentum (-6.5% over 4 weeks) and experienced a \"sell the news\" pattern after record Q1 2026 earnings on Jan 29. Despite strong fundamentals (23% iPhone revenue growth, earnings beat), the stock fell post-announcement as investors focused on margin guidance concerns. With no major catalysts before Feb 15 and recent downward pressure, I estimate slightly below 50% probability of a higher close.",
