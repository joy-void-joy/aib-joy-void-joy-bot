  "summary": "OpenAI has not filed an S-1 with the SEC as of February 7, 2026, with only ~36 days remaining before the March 15 deadline. All reporting indicates OpenAI's CFO targets a 2027 listing with H2 2026 as the earliest possible filing timeline. The company is still in informal bank discussions and hasn't completed prerequisite steps like a major fundraising round. Manifold prices an even broader \"IPO by March 2026\" question at just 1.4%. The Metaculus CP is 10%, which seems generous given the overwhelming evidence against an imminent filing. This is essentially a question of whether an extremely unlikely surprise occurs in the next 5 weeks.",
