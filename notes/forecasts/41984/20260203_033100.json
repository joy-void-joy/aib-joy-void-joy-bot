  "summary": "Meta-prediction with CP exactly at 40% threshold. Abu Dhabi trilateral talks (Feb 4-5) will generate news before the Feb 14 resolution. Energy ceasefire and diplomatic momentum are positive signals, but territorial deadlock persists and Manifold markets (36.5%) are below Metaculus. Large forecaster base (874) is slow to move. Effectively a coin flip with slight downward pressure from market signals.",
