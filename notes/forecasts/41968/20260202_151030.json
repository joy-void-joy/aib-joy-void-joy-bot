  "summary": "The RPONTSYD series tracks temporary open market repo operations, which have been essentially dormant since mid-2020 when the Standing Repo Facility (SRF) replaced them as the Fed's liquidity backstop. Recent values are consistently 0.000-0.002 billion. Current market conditions are stable (Fed ended QT Dec 2025, implemented reserve management purchases), and February 10 is a normal business day with no stress catalysts. The distribution is heavily concentrated near zero with a small tail for unexpected market events.",
