  "summary": "The RPONTSYD series tracks overnight Treasury repo operations by the Fed, which have been essentially dormant recently (0.000-0.002 billion in late January 2026). The Fed ended quantitative tightening in December 2025, reducing systemic pressure. February 10 is a regular Tuesday with no month-end, quarter-end, or special liquidity pressures. While tail events are possible (Oct 2025: $29.4B, Dec 2025: $74.6B spikes), these were driven by specific pressures that don't apply. The distribution is heavily concentrated near zero with fat tails for unexpected stress events.",
