  "summary": "The key driver is the NTSB Potomac crash hearing on January 27, 2026, which likely elevated \"helicopter\" search interest (current value 60 on Feb 1). News interest typically decays exponentially with a ~3-7 day half-life. By Feb 3 (7 days post-hearing), interest should be declining; by Feb 14 (18 days), it should be substantially lower absent new news. No major helicopter events are scheduled during Feb 3-14 (the International Military Helicopter conference is Feb 24-26, outside the window). The \u00b13 threshold is relatively narrow for an 11-day window, making \"Decreases\" most likely as the news story fades, with \"Doesn't change\" possible if the decline is gradual. \"Increases\" would require an unexpected news event like a new crash.",
