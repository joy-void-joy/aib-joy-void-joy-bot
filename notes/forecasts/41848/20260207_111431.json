  "summary": "The question asks whether Meta will settle the state AG coalition lawsuit (People of California v. Meta Platforms, 4:23-cv-05448) before March 1, 2026 \u2014 only ~21 days from today. The evidence overwhelmingly points to No. The case is deep in active litigation: discovery disputes were ongoing through late 2025, a stipulation about pre-motion letter briefs was filed in September 2025, states sought to combine their claims into a single trial as recently as December 2025, and federal bellwether trials aren't expected until summer/late 2026. Meta has shown no willingness to settle \u2014 it proceeded to trial in the LA bellwether case (Jan 2026) and is fighting the NM AG trial (Feb 2026) while TikTok and Snap settled. Legal sources explicitly state \"no Facebook or Meta lawsuit mental health settlements have been announced yet\" as of February 2026. A comprehensive settlement with 30+ states on complex issues of platform design and youth addiction cannot realistically be negotiated, agreed upon, and formally documented in 21 days when there are no signs of settlement talks having even begun. The community prediction of 29% appears significantly too high, likely reflecting the novelty of the question.",
