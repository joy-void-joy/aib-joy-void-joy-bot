  "summary": "Mounjaro Q1 2026 revenue forecast based on strong historical growth trajectory. Q1 2025 was $3.84B with 112% YoY growth; Q3 2025 reached $6.52B with 109% YoY growth. Supply constraints have eased, international expansion continues, and tirzepatide became world's best-selling drug franchise. Expecting ~75-85% YoY growth for Q1 2026 as the base case, with some moderation from recent rates as the revenue base grows larger. Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 4, 2026) will provide additional calibration data. Central estimate around $7.0B with wide intervals reflecting timing uncertainty.",
