  "summary": "This is a short-term (8-9 trading day) stock comparison with no major catalyst in the window. UHS has declined ~11% over the past month but appears undervalued (P/E 8.83 vs industry 10.18). The healthcare sector has a bullish outlook for 2026. With no earnings until March 4, this is essentially a base rate question with slight positive bias from equity drift, potential mean reversion, and sector tailwinds. The forecast is marginally above 50%.",
