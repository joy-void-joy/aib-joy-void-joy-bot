  "summary": "Brent crude is trading ~$66-67/barrel with 11 days to resolution. Historical volatility of ~6% over this period suggests moderate uncertainty. Bearish fundamentals (EIA forecasts $56 average for 2026, OPEC supply surplus) are offset by geopolitical risk premium from US-Iran tensions. Distribution centered near current price with slight downward bias from fundamentals and upside tail from geopolitical risk.",
