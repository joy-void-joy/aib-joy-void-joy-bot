  "summary": "PCG's Feb 13 close vs Feb 4 close ($15.895) depends heavily on the Q4 2025 earnings call scheduled for Feb 12. PG&E has a strong track record of beating estimates (Q3 beat by 13.64%) and has unanimous Buy ratings from analysts with 30% upside to price targets. However, today's +3.62% move sets a higher baseline, and earnings events introduce significant uncertainty. The positive company fundamentals and beat history provide a slight edge toward YES, but this is close to a coin flip given earnings uncertainty.",
