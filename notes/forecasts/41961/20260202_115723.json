  "summary": "The 5-year Treasury yield on February 10, 2026 should remain close to the current level of 3.80%. With no FOMC meeting before resolution (next is March 17-18), Fed policy unchanged at 3.50-3.75%, and only 6 trading days until resolution, the status quo dominates. Using conservative volatility estimates (~17 bps over the horizon) to account for potential tariff-related news and economic data releases, the median forecast is approximately 3.79% with an 80% confidence interval of roughly 3.57-4.01%.",
