  "summary": "The 7-year Treasury yield (DGS7) stood at 4.01% on Jan 30, 2026, with a tight 4-bp range over the preceding week. With only 7 trading days to resolution and typical daily volatility of ~5 bps, the yield is unlikely to move substantially. Kevin Warsh's nomination as Fed Chair introduces a slight hawkish bias, but markets remain calm with two Fed rate cuts still priced for 2026. Monte Carlo simulation with fat tails (Student-t distribution) centers the forecast at ~4.01% with an 80% confidence interval of 3.85% to 4.18%.",
