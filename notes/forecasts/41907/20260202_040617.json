  "summary": "Tesla Q1 2026 deliveries should recover from the depressed Q1 2025 (336,681) when Model Y changeover disrupted production, but remain below Q1 2024 (386,810) due to persistent regional demand weakness. Europe fell 28% in 2025, China down 7%, and the US lost the $7,500 EV tax credit in September 2025. The Kalshi prediction market implies a median of ~330,000 vehicles, while Barclays estimates ~350,000. I weight slightly above market consensus due to the Model Y changeover headwind being removed. Manifold gives only 38% probability that 2026 deliveries exceed 2025, reflecting overall bearish sentiment on Tesla's vehicle business.",
