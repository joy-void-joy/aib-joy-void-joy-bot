  "summary": "Charles Victor Thompson was executed on January 28, 2026. Google Trends shows classic post-event decay: peak of 100 on Jan 29, now at ~1 on Feb 5. With the current value at the floor, \"Decreases\" is mathematically impossible (would require negative values). \"Doesn't change\" is highly likely as both Feb 5 and Feb 12 will be near 0-1. \"Increases\" would require unexpected news (documentary, death penalty debate, true crime coverage), which is possible but unlikely in a 7-day window.",
