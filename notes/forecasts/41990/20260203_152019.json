  "summary": "The \"hospital\" search term is stable with documented weekly periodicity (weekday > weekend). Comparing Tuesday (Feb 3) to Sunday (Feb 15) creates a slight bias toward decreases. The severe flu season is past peak and stabilizing, reducing spike probability. The \u00b13 threshold is narrow but could absorb normal variation. I weight toward \"doesn't change\" and \"decreases\" roughly equally, with lower probability on \"increases\" absent unexpected health news.",
