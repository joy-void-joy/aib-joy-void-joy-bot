  "summary": "This question asks whether Google Trends interest in \"amber alert\" will change by more than \u00b13 points between Feb 2 and Feb 14, 2026. The current baseline is 19 (relatively low), suggesting a quiet period. Monte Carlo simulations with different volatility assumptions suggest \"Doesn't change\" is most likely (43%) due to status quo bias and low baseline volatility. However, \"Increases\" (32%) has meaningful probability because amber alerts cause unpredictable search spikes - a single high-profile alert could push values above the threshold. \"Decreases\" (25%) is less likely because the low baseline limits downward movement and spike events only push values upward. The 12-day window creates moderate uncertainty across all outcomes.",
