  "summary": "Google Trends term \"fafo\" is politically active, used by Trump administration and Republican politicians. Currently at level 26 (moderate baseline). The State of the Union is scheduled for Feb 24, AFTER the Feb 2-15 resolution window, so no major spike catalyst is scheduled. However, ongoing political news (government shutdown, immigration) could trigger usage. The ±3 threshold is relatively narrow for a 13-day period with a politically charged term. I estimate moderate probability of stability with slightly higher chance of increase than decrease due to active political use.",
