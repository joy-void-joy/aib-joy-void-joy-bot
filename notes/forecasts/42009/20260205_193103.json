  "summary": "Steve Tisch was implicated in Epstein files released Jan 31, 2026, driving a major spike in search interest. The NFL is investigating, and Goodell addressed it at his Super Bowl press conference (Feb 2). Super Bowl LX is Feb 8, in the middle of the forecasting window. The question compares Feb 5 (day 5 post-story) to Feb 13 (day 13 post-story). Standard news decay patterns suggest interest will decline substantially over this 8-day period. While Super Bowl coverage may sustain interest briefly on Feb 8, by Feb 13 the story will be nearly 2 weeks old with the Super Bowl passed. The \u00b13 point threshold is narrow enough that significant decay is likely to exceed it. \"Decreases\" is most probable, with \"Doesn't change\" possible if both days happen to land at similar points on the decay curve.",
