# Meta-Reflection: Q40919 - US Government Shutdown Before February 1, 2026

## Executive Summary
- **Post ID**: 40919
- **Title**: Will the US government enter a shutdown before February 1, 2026?
- **Final Forecast**: 0.97 (97%)
- **Confidence Level**: Very High

This is a definitional question about a past event. Today is February 4, 2026. The question asks about events before February 1, 2026. Research confirms that a partial government shutdown began at midnight on January 30→31, 2026, with furloughs of federal employees (10,000+ FAA workers, State Department employees). This clearly meets all resolution criteria.

## Research Audit

### Searches Run
1. **WebSearch "US government shutdown January 2026"** - Excellent results, provided multiple news sources confirming shutdown
2. **WebFetch Wikipedia** - Failed (403), but not needed
3. **WebFetch NPR article** - Confirmed shutdown began midnight January 31, 2026
4. **WebFetch ABC News** - Confirmed shutdown details
5. **WebSearch "federal employees furloughed"** - Confirmed 10,000+ FAA furloughs, State Dept furloughs

### Most Informative Sources
- Government Executive article on furloughs
- Baltimore Sun on FAA furloughs
- FedManager on House vote to end shutdown

## Reasoning Quality Check

### Strongest Evidence FOR my forecast (YES):
1. **Shutdown definitively occurred on January 31, 2026** - Multiple credible sources (NPR, ABC, CBS) confirm funding lapsed at midnight
2. **Federal employees were furloughed** - 10,000+ FAA workers, ~8,000 State Dept employees - clearly meets "shutdown furlough" requirement
3. **Shutdown described as "four-day old"** when ended Feb 3 - confirms Jan 31 start date (before Feb 1)

### Strongest Argument AGAINST my forecast:
- Could there be interpretation issues with "before February 1"? No - midnight Jan 30→31 is unambiguously before Feb 1
- Did furloughs actually happen or just threatened? Sources confirm furloughs were executed, not just planned

### Calibration Check
- **Question type**: Definitional (past event, not prediction)
- **Did I apply appropriate skepticism?** This isn't a prediction - it's verifying what happened. The evidence is overwhelming and consistent across multiple sources.
- **Is my uncertainty calibrated?** 97% leaves 3% for potential edge cases (resolution source disagreement, question annulment, etc.)

## Subagent Decision
- **Did I use subagents?** No
- **Should I have?** No - this is a simple definitional question where web search immediately answered the question. No need for parallel research.

## Tool Effectiveness
- **Useful tools**: WebSearch (excellent for recent news), WebFetch (worked for NPR/ABC)
- **Actual failures**: WebFetch Wikipedia (403 error)
- **No results found**: N/A - all searches returned relevant results

## Process Feedback
- Prompt guidance on definitional questions was applicable - focused on resolution criteria parsing
- "Nothing Ever Happens" adjustment NOT applicable - this is a past event, not a prediction

## Calibration Tracking
- **Confidence**: 97% that question resolves YES
- **Update triggers**: Would update down if I found evidence the furloughs didn't actually occur, or if "before February 1" has unexpected interpretation
