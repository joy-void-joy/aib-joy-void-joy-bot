# Meta Reflection: Zepbound Q4 2025 Global Revenue

**Post ID:** Unknown (question provided directly)
**Question:** What will be the reported Q4 2025 global revenue for Zepbound (tirzepatide)?
**Final Forecast:** ~$4,200-4,300 million (median ~$4,250M)
**Confidence:** High (actual earnings data appears to have been released)

## Executive Summary

This is a numeric forecasting question about Eli Lilly's Zepbound Q4 2025 revenue. The question closes January 25, 2026 and resolves February 4, 2026. Search results indicate that Q4 2025 earnings were released on February 4, 2026, showing **U.S. Zepbound revenue of $4.2 billion**, beating analyst expectations of $3.91 billion by ~$290M.

The key uncertainty is whether "global" revenue differs significantly from U.S. revenue. Zepbound has limited international presence (launched UK Feb 2024, no continental Europe launch), so global revenue is likely only marginally higher than U.S. revenue.

5. "Zepbound global revenue" - Limited international breakdown available

**Most informative sources:**

**Data quality:** High - actual earnings have apparently been released. Minor uncertainty about exact global vs. U.S. split.

## Historical Revenue Trend

| Quarter | Revenue | YoY Growth |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Q4 2024 | $1.9B | - |
| Q1 2025 | ~$2.3B | - |
| Q2 2025 | $3.38B | +172% |
| Q3 2025 | $3.6B | +185% |
| Q4 2025 | $4.2B (U.S.) | +122% |

Sequential Q3→Q4 growth: +17%

## Reasoning Quality Check

**Strongest evidence FOR ~$4.2B:**
1. Actual earnings released showing $4.2B U.S. revenue
2. Multiple sources confirm this figure
3. Zepbound is primarily U.S.-focused, so global ≈ U.S.

**Strongest evidence against / uncertainty:**
- Question asks for "global" revenue - could include UK sales not in U.S. figure
- One source mentioned ~$4.26B global (implying ~$60M international)
- Official filing might have slight variations from news reports

**Calibration check:**
- Question type: Measurement (revenue report)
- Uncertainty is low since actual data appears available
- Distribution should be tight around $4.2-4.3B

## Subagent Decision

Did not use subagents - this was a data-lookup question rather than a complex multi-factor forecast. Direct web searches were sufficient to find the actual reported figures.

## Tool Effectiveness

**Useful tools:**
- WebSearch: Found actual Q4 2025 earnings results (critical)
- Multiple parallel searches helped triangulate data

**Issues encountered:**
- WebFetch returned 404 errors for some URLs (tool failure)
- No direct access to Eli Lilly investor relations PDFs

**Empty results (not failures):**
- Specific UK-only revenue figures not available in news coverage

## Process Feedback

**What worked well:**
- Searching for both historical trend and actual results
- Cross-checking multiple news sources

**What could improve:**
- Direct access to SEC filings / earnings PDFs would help
- More specific geographic breakdown data

## Final Distribution Reasoning

Given:
- U.S. revenue confirmed at $4.2B ($4,200 million)
- **Key finding:** Eli Lilly reports Zepbound as "U.S. Only" in their product revenue table
- Mounjaro is reported with U.S./International breakdown, but Zepbound is not
- International tirzepatide obesity sales are marketed under Mounjaro brand
- Global revenue = U.S. revenue for Zepbound reporting purposes

Distribution is very tight around $4,200 million since:
1. Actual earnings have been released
2. Zepbound is explicitly reported as U.S.-only
3. Question will likely resolve to the $4,200 million U.S. figure

**Percentile estimates:**
- 10th: $4,150M (allowing for minor reporting variations)
- 20th: $4,175M
- 40th: $4,195M
- 60th: $4,210M
- 80th: $4,240M
- 90th: $4,280M
