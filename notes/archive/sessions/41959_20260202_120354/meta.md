# Meta Reflection: Laken Riley Google Trends (Q41959)

## Executive Summary
- **Question ID**: 41959
- **Title**: Will the interest in "laken riley" change between 2026-02-02 and 2026-02-15 according to Google Trends?
- **Final Forecast**: Decreases (45%), Doesn't change (40%), Increases (15%)
- **Confidence**: Moderate

## Research Process

### Strategy
1. Identified who Laken Riley was and why interest might fluctuate
2. Mapped key dates (death anniversary, Act anniversary, court events)
3. Researched recent news events that could affect Feb 2 starting value
4. Looked for scheduled events in Feb 2-15 window

### Key Findings
- Laken Riley murdered Feb 22, 2024 (anniversary AFTER resolution window)
- Laken Riley Act one-year anniversary: Jan 29, 2026
- Jose Ibarra new trial hearing: Jan 31, 2026 (2 days before window starts)
- Memorial 5K run: Feb 21, 2026 (AFTER resolution window)
- Judge's ruling on new trial: After March 2, 2026 (AFTER resolution window)
- Current interest level (Feb 1): 14 (low baseline)

### Most Valuable Sources
- Web search for recent news revealed the Jan 31 hearing
- Wikipedia for establishing timeline of events
- News search confirmed no scheduled events in Feb 2-15 window

## Reasoning Quality

### Strongest Evidence
1. **Recent news spike**: The Jan 29-31 events (Act anniversary + new trial hearing) likely elevated interest around Feb 2
2. **No scheduled events**: Nothing between Feb 2-15 to sustain interest
3. **Anniversary timing**: The death anniversary (Feb 22) falls AFTER the resolution window

### Key Uncertainties
- How much did Feb 2 capture elevated interest vs. already being normalized?
- Will there be unexpected political mentions or news developments?
- How much noise is in Google Trends day-to-day data?

### "Nothing Ever Happens" Applied
- Unlikely there will be breaking news about this case in the window
- Judge's ruling not expected until after March 2
- Anniversary coverage typically starts close to the date, not 2 weeks early

## Calibration Notes
- The ±3 point threshold is forgiving, making "Doesn't change" plausible
- Low baseline values (14) mean smaller absolute changes needed for resolution
- Moderate confidence - news could always surprise

## Process Improvements
- Would have been helpful to see historical resolution patterns for similar Google Trends questions
- Understanding typical day-to-day noise in Google Trends would improve precision
