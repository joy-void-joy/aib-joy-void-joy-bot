# Meta Reflection: AAPL Price Feb 15 vs Feb 2

**Question**: Will AAPL's market close price on 2026-02-15 be higher than its market close price on 2026-02-02?

**Final Forecast**: 47% probability YES

## Executive Summary

This is a short-term stock price movement question over approximately 10 trading days. The base rate for a stock increasing over this period is ~52% (slight positive drift). However, AAPL has recent negative momentum (-6.5% over 4 weeks) and is experiencing a "sell the news" pattern despite record Q1 2026 earnings. My forecast of 47% reflects a slight negative adjustment from the base rate.

## Research Process

**Strategy**: Started with web searches for current price, recent news, and earnings context. Then did quantitative base rate calculation using standard stock return distribution.

**Most valuable sources**:
- Web search revealing current price (~$253-259) and recent 6.5% decline
- Q1 2026 earnings results (record-breaking but stock fell post-announcement)
- Market outlook searches showing general bullishness for 2026 but near-term volatility concerns

**Key base rate**: Using random walk with drift model, ~52% probability of positive return over 10 trading days.

## Tool Effectiveness

**Worked well**:
- WebSearch: Quickly found current price, earnings context, market outlook
- execute_code: Useful for quantitative base rate calculation

**Not useful**:
- Polymarket: No relevant AAPL markets found
- Wikipedia: Not needed for this type of current financial question

## Reasoning Quality

**Strongest evidence**:
1. Base rate of ~52% for 10-day positive return
2. Recent 6.5% decline suggests negative momentum
3. Post-earnings "sell the news" pattern after Jan 29 announcement

**Key uncertainties**:
- Whether post-earnings weakness will continue or reverse
- General market conditions between Feb 2-15
- Unpredictable short-term price movements

**"Nothing Ever Happens" application**: The status quo is continuation of recent downward trend, which supports slightly below 50% probability.

## Calibration Notes

**Confidence**: Moderate. Short-term stock movements are inherently noisy and near-random.

**What would update me**:
- Major news (positive: new product announcement; negative: executive departure, supply chain issue)
- Significant market-wide moves
- Any Apple-specific catalyst I'm not aware of

## Process Improvements

For stock price questions like this, the approach is fairly straightforward:
1. Get current price and recent trend
2. Check for any upcoming catalysts
3. Apply base rate with momentum adjustment
4. Keep probability close to 50% since short-term movements are essentially noise
