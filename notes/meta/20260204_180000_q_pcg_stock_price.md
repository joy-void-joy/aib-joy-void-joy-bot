- **Confidence**: Low-moderate (earnings event dominates)
- **Approach**: Stock data analysis + earnings event assessment

## Key Data Points
- Feb 4 close (reference): $15.895 (up 3.62% today)
- 52-week range: $12.97 - $17.95

## Research Audit
### Searches Performed
1. `stock_price(PCG)` - Got current price and key metrics ✓
2. `stock_history(PCG, 3mo)` - Got price history ✓
3. WebSearch for PG&E news - Found earnings date, analyst sentiment ✓
4. WebSearch for earnings expectations - Found EPS estimates, track record ✓

### Most Informative Sources
- Stock history showing recent volatility and today's big move
- Earnings date (Feb 12) and EPS estimate ($0.38)
- Q3 2025 beat (13.64% over estimates)
- Unanimous Buy rating from 13 analysts

## Reasoning Quality Check

### Strongest Evidence FOR (YES)
1. PG&E has consistently beaten earnings estimates (Q3 beat by 13.64%)
2. Unanimous Buy rating with 30% upside to targets
3. Strong company guidance (10% EPS growth, data center pipeline)

### Strongest Arguments AGAINST (NO)
1. Today's +3.62% move may have priced in optimism, setting higher bar
2. Earnings events are inherently uncertain - even beats can lead to "sell the news"
3. The question resolves vs today's elevated close, not a neutral baseline

### What Would Change My Mind
- News of specific earnings concerns would push me lower
- Confirmed pre-earnings positive guidance revision would push higher

## Calibration Check
- Question type: Measurement/comparison (stock price)
- The earnings event on Feb 12 dominates all other factors
- "Nothing Ever Happens" doesn't strongly apply - earnings WILL happen and move the stock
- Uncertainty is appropriately high given binary earnings outcome

## Subagent Decision
- Did not use subagents - question is straightforward stock comparison
- Data was readily available via direct tools
- No need for complex research or Fermi estimation

## Tool Effectiveness
- stock_price and stock_history worked perfectly
- WebSearch found key earnings date information
- No tool failures

## Process Feedback
- The guidance on measurement questions applies well here
- The key was identifying the earnings event as the dominant factor
- Standard stock base rates (~52%) only slightly inform the forecast

## Calibration Tracking
- Confidence: ~53% (very close to coin flip with slight positive lean)
- Key update trigger: Any pre-earnings news would shift this significantly
- If I were tracking: note that company beat history and analyst sentiment provide mild positive tilt
