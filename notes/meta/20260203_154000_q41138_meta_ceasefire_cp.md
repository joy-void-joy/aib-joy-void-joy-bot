# Meta Reflection: Will Ceasefire CP Rise Above 40%?

**Post ID**: Meta question about post 41138
**Question**: Will the community prediction be higher than 40.00% on 2026-02-14 for the Russia-Ukraine ceasefire question?
**Final Forecast**: ~47%
**Date**: 2026-02-03

## Executive Summary

This is a meta-prediction question asking whether the Metaculus community prediction for a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire will rise above 40% by Feb 14. Currently at exactly 40%, this is effectively a coin flip with several competing factors.

## Research Audit

**Searches performed:**
1. Metaculus question details (post 41138) - useful for understanding current state
2. Coherence links - none found
3. Polymarket/Manifold markets - Manifold showed 36.5-41.5% range, useful
4. Web searches for recent news (x3) - highly informative

**Key sources:**
- Al Jazeera coverage of Abu Dhabi talks
- NBC News on trilateral negotiations
- CNBC on Trump-Putin discussions

**Effort**: ~6 tool calls, systematic research

## Reasoning Quality Check

### Strongest evidence FOR (YES - CP rises above 40%):
1. Active diplomacy: Abu Dhabi talks happening Feb 4-5 (tomorrow!)
2. Energy ceasefire being largely observed by Russia
3. Some momentum: "90% agreed" on 20-point plan per Zelenskyy
4. Any positive news from upcoming talks would likely nudge CP up

### Strongest argument AGAINST (NO - CP stays ≤ 40%):
1. First trilateral round made "little progress" on territory
2. Manifold markets (36.5%) are below Metaculus (40%)
3. Territory issue (Donetsk) remains intractable deadlock
4. Large forecaster base (874) = slow to move
5. "Nothing Ever Happens" - ceasefires are rare even with talks

### What would a smart disagreer say?
- "Markets are lower than Metaculus - the crowd might drift DOWN not up"
- "Territory deadlock is the core issue and it's not getting resolved in 11 days"

### What would change my mind?
- +15%: Major breakthrough announced at Abu Dhabi talks
- -15%: Talks collapse, fighting escalates

### Calibration check:
- Question type: Meta-prediction
- Applied: Modeled forecaster behavior, not underlying event
- Uncertainty: High - we're at exact threshold, and major news event coming

## Subagent Decision

Did not use subagents. This question is about forecaster behavior in response to news over 11 days. The key information (current CP, recent news, market signals) was gathered efficiently in main thread. Subagents would add overhead without benefit.

## Tool Effectiveness

**Worked well:**
- WebSearch for recent news (comprehensive coverage of talks)
- Manifold market prices (useful signal)

**Unhelpful:**
- Polymarket search (returned sports results, no relevant Ukraine markets found)
- Coherence links (none available)

## Process Feedback

- Good: Prompt guidance on meta-predictions and large forecaster bases being sticky
- This question benefits from the "model forecasters not the event" framing
- The threshold being exactly at current CP makes this highly uncertain

## Calibration Tracking

- Confidence: 47% probability of YES
- Comparable: Other threshold questions at exact boundary
- Update triggers:
  - Abu Dhabi talks outcome (Feb 4-5) is critical
  - Any breakthrough announcement would push toward YES
  - Collapse of talks would push toward NO
