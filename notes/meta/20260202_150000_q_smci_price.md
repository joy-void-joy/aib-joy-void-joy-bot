# Meta Reflection: SMCI Stock Price Forecast

**Question**: Will SMCI's market close price on 2026-02-14 be higher than its market close price on 2026-02-02?

**Final Forecast**: ~48% probability (YES)

## Executive Summary

This is an 8-trading-day stock price comparison question dominated by a single catalyst: Q2 FY2026 earnings release on February 3, 2026 (after market close). The stock is near 52-week lows after declining ~45% in 3 months, trading in a technical support zone of $28-30. The key uncertainty is earnings outcome, with SMCI having missed in 5 of 8 recent quarters.

## Research Process

### Strategy
1. Searched for current price and recent news
2. Identified the critical catalyst (earnings on Feb 3)
3. Gathered analyst expectations and historical miss rate
4. Looked for technical support levels
5. Checked prediction markets (no relevant markets found)

### Most Valuable Sources
- Web search for earnings date and analyst expectations
- Historical miss rate data (5/8 quarters)
- Options implied volatility (~12% expected move)

### What Didn't Help
- Polymarket/Manifold had no relevant markets for this stock

## Key Evidence

**For YES (price higher):**
- Stock near 52-week low ($25.71), at strong support zone ($28-30)
- Already down 45% in 3 months - bad news may be priced in
- Raised FY2026 revenue guidance to $36B
- $13B backlog signals strong demand
- Technical buy signals from MACD
- Analyst median target $44-48 (50%+ upside)

**For NO (price lower):**
- Missed earnings in 5 of 8 recent quarters (62.5%)
- Goldman Sachs Sell rating with $26 target
- Margin pressures and competition concerns
- Options imply 12% move - could go either direction

## Reasoning Quality

The question is essentially a coin flip weighted by the earnings outcome. Key uncertainties:
1. Will SMCI beat/miss earnings consensus ($0.49 EPS)?
2. Will guidance be strong enough?
3. How much bad news is already priced in?

The 62.5% historical miss rate argues for slight pessimism, but the beaten-down valuation and technical support argue the other way.

## Calibration Notes

- The "Nothing Ever Happens" principle doesn't apply cleanly here - something WILL happen (earnings)
- The question is which way it moves
- Near 50% reflects genuine uncertainty
- Would update significantly based on earnings results

## Process Improvements

- For short-term stock questions with known catalysts, could use more systematic approach to estimate probability of earnings beat
- Could have looked for more specific data on SMCI's typical post-earnings moves
