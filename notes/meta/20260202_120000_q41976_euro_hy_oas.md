# Meta-Reflection: Euro HY OAS Forecast (Q41976)

**Question ID:** 41976
**Title:** ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread on 2026-02-12
**Final Forecast:** Median ~2.67%, 80% CI [2.55%, 2.85%]
**Confidence:** Moderate

## Executive Summary

This question asks for the Euro High Yield OAS on Feb 12, 2026, with current data showing 2.64% on Jan 31. The short time horizon (~8 trading days) and stable market conditions suggest the spread will remain near current levels with modest positive skew (widening risk exceeds compression potential at historical tights).

## Research Process

**Strategy:** Started with FRED data source, then contextualized with market outlook research.

**Most valuable sources:**
- FRED direct data (current value 2.64%)
- BNP Paribas and Alliance Bernstein outlooks (context on tight spreads, historical comparisons)
- ECB calendar (Feb 4-5 meeting adds slight uncertainty)
- ECB Financial Stability Review (risk factors)

**Key findings:**
1. Spreads at ~2.64% are near historical tights (historical average ~5.6%)
2. ECB meeting Feb 4-5 before resolution - likely hold, but adds uncertainty
3. Default rates low (~3%), supportive fundamentals
4. Geopolitical tail risks (Ukraine, trade tensions) exist but are priced

## Tool Effectiveness

**High value:**
- WebSearch: Good for market outlook pieces
- WebFetch on FRED: Got recent data points
- execute_code: Essential for Monte Carlo simulation

**Medium value:**
- search_metaculus: Found related questions but no community predictions available

**Not used:**
- Prediction markets (no Euro HY spread markets found)
- Subagents (question was straightforward enough to handle directly)

## Reasoning Quality

**Strongest evidence:**
1. Current spread value is well-established (2.64% on Jan 31)
2. Short time horizon limits expected volatility
3. Spreads near tights = asymmetric risk profile (more widening room than compression)

**Key uncertainties:**
1. Geopolitical shocks could widen spreads significantly
2. ECB meeting outcome (though hold is heavily priced)
3. Short-term market sentiment shifts

**"Nothing Ever Happens" application:**
- Applied appropriately - status quo (spreads stay near 2.64%) assigned ~72% probability
- Tail events (severe stress) only 3% probability

## Process Improvements

**What I'd do differently:**
- Try to find actual historical volatility data for this specific index
- The 8bp standard deviation assumption was based on general credit market knowledge, not empirical measurement

**System gaps:**
- Would benefit from direct FRED API access for historical data download
- No good source for intraday or recent historical volatility

## Calibration Notes

**Confidence level:** Moderate (7/10)
- Very short time horizon reduces uncertainty
- Credit spreads are relatively predictable over 1-2 weeks absent shocks
- Distribution captures fat-tailed widening risk

**Would update significantly if:**
- Major geopolitical event before Feb 12
- Unexpected ECB action on Feb 5
- US market stress spilling over to Europe

## System Design Reflection

**Tool gaps:**
- Would love a "get FRED historical data" tool that returns actual time series for volatility analysis
- Current tools work well for point-in-time data but not for statistical analysis

**Subagent usage:**
- Didn't use subagents here - question was straightforward enough
- For similar financial data questions, a "market data" specialized agent could help

**Prompt fit:**
- Guidance was appropriate for this financial time series question
- Monte Carlo approach worked well for capturing asymmetric risks

**If building from scratch:**
- Add structured financial data tools (FRED API, Bloomberg-style)
- Consider specialized "financial forecaster" subagent with built-in volatility models
