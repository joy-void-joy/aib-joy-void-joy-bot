# Meta-Reflection: 3-Month Treasury Yield Forecast

**Question**: What will be the value of DGS3MO (3-month Treasury yield) on 2026-02-10?
**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Resolution**: 2026-02-10 (8 days out)

## Executive Summary

This is a short-term (8-day) forecast for the 3-month Treasury yield. The current yield is 3.67% (Jan 29, 2026), and the Fed just held rates at 3.50-3.75% on January 28 with no meeting until March 17-18. The yield should remain highly stable in the 3.6-3.7% range.

**Final forecast**: Median ~3.66%, with 80% CI of approximately 3.56-3.76%

## Research Process

### Strategy
For this short-term financial forecast, I focused on:
1. Current Fed policy and recent decisions
2. Latest yield data points
3. Upcoming economic events that could move rates
4. Historical volatility characteristics

### Sources Used
- FRED DGS3MO series: Most recent values
- Federal Reserve H.15 release: Secondary market rates
- FOMC statement from January 28, 2026: Rate hold confirmed
- BLS calendar: Jobs report Feb 6 before resolution

### Key Findings
1. **Fed held steady**: 3.50-3.75% range maintained on Jan 28, 2026
2. **Next FOMC**: March 17-18 (well after resolution)
3. **Recent yield stability**: 3.66-3.70% range over past week (only 4 bps)
4. **Jobs report Feb 6**: Could create small moves but Fed won't act until March

## Tool Effectiveness

### Most Valuable
- **WebSearch**: Quickly found FOMC decision details and current Fed policy
- **WebFetch on FRED**: Got exact recent yield values

### Less Useful
- **Polymarket**: No relevant Fed rate markets returned
- **TradingEconomics calendar**: 405 error

## Reasoning Quality

### Strongest Evidence
- Fed funds rate anchors 3-month yield tightly
- No FOMC meeting before resolution
- Recent yield extremely stable (4 bps weekly range)
- Current yield ~3.67% is within Fed target range

### Key Uncertainties
- Jobs report Feb 6 could cause some movement
- Unexpected geopolitical/market events
- Market could price in March meeting expectations

### "Nothing Ever Happens" Check
This is a highly stable financial instrument with clear anchoring to Fed policy. The status quo (yield staying near 3.66%) is the strong default.

## Process Improvements

The forecast was straightforward given the short time horizon and clear anchoring mechanism (Fed funds rate). The main challenge was determining appropriate uncertainty width for such a stable metric.

## Calibration Notes

**Confidence**: High that the yield stays within 3.55-3.80%
**Update triggers**:
- Major market turmoil would shift expectations
- Significantly hot/cold economic data could move expectations for March Fed meeting
