# Meta Reflection: Luigi Mangione Google Trends Forecast

**Question ID**: Unknown (provided directly)
**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Final Forecast**: Decreases: 50%, Doesn't change: 30%, Increases: 20%

## Executive Summary

This question asks whether Google Trends interest in "luigi mangione" will increase, decrease, or stay the same (within ±3 points) between Feb 2-15, 2026. My analysis focused on recent news events and an upcoming court hearing to determine likely search interest patterns.

## Research Process

### Strategy
1. Searched for recent Mangione news to understand current context
2. Identified upcoming events in the forecasting window
3. Researched typical Google Trends decay patterns after news events
4. Checked prediction markets (none found for this specific question)

### Key Findings
1. **January 30 ruling**: Major news - death penalty off the table, evidence admissible. This likely spiked interest right before the forecasting period starts.
2. **January 29**: Bizarre story about man trying to break Mangione out of jail
3. **February 6 hearing**: Unexpected state court hearing scheduled within the forecasting period. Reason unknown, but likely about trial scheduling.
4. **Trial dates**: Federal trial Oct 13, state wants July 1

### Most Valuable Sources
- ABC News and NBC News for recent court developments
- Wikipedia for background context
- Multiple news sources confirming Feb 6 hearing

## Reasoning Quality

### Strongest Evidence
1. The Jan 30 death penalty ruling was major news that likely elevated interest at the start of the period
2. Google Trends research shows exponential decay after news spikes
3. Feb 6 hearing appears procedural (scheduling), not substantive

### Key Uncertainties
1. Why was the Feb 6 hearing called? Unknown reason adds uncertainty
2. Exact current Trends value on Feb 2 vs Feb 1 (could have shifted)
3. Whether prosecutors will make unexpected announcements

### "Nothing Ever Happens" Applied
Yes - procedural court hearings typically don't generate sustained interest increases. The status quo is gradual decay.

## Calibration Notes

**Confidence**: Medium. The Feb 6 hearing is the main wild card.

**Would update significantly if**:
- Feb 6 hearing reveals major unexpected development (new charges, plea deal, etc.)
- Another dramatic news event (another jailbreak attempt, major ruling)

## Process Improvements

For future similar questions:
- Could try to access Google Trends data directly to see current trajectory
- More specific research on court hearing agendas when available
