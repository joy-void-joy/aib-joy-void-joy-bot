# Meta Reflection: NASDAQ 100 Index on 2026-02-12

**Question ID**: 41981
**Date**: 2026-02-02
**Final Forecast**: Median ~25,800, 80% CI: 24,400 - 27,300

## 1. Executive Summary

This question asks for the NASDAQ 100 Index value on February 12, 2026 - approximately 8 trading days from now. The current value is ~25,741. My approach used VXN-implied volatility (22% annualized) to construct a log-normal distribution, with Monte Carlo simulation verification and fat-tail adjustments.

**Key conclusion**: The market is likely to remain in a range of ~24,400-27,300 (80% CI), with the central estimate around current levels given the short time horizon.

## 2. Research Process

### Strategy
- Started with current market data from web search
- Retrieved FRED historical data to understand recent price action
- Checked VXN volatility index for market-implied expectations
- Researched upcoming catalysts (earnings, FOMC, economic data)
- Ran quantitative simulation in Python

### Most Valuable Sources
- Real-time market data showing NASDAQ 100 at 25,741 (Feb 2)
- FRED data showing recent values (Jan 26-30): 25,713 → 26,022 → 25,552
- VXN at 19.49% - key input for volatility estimate
- Earnings calendar: Amazon (Feb 5), Alphabet (Feb 4) - major catalysts

### Gaps
- Could not find a Metaculus question record (404 error) - may be a new question
- No prediction markets on this specific question

## 3. Tool Effectiveness

### Highly Effective
- **WebSearch**: Excellent for current market data, earnings dates, and outlook
- **execute_code**: Essential for Monte Carlo simulation and percentile calculations
- **WebFetch on FRED**: Good for recent historical data

### Missing Capabilities
- Direct API access to financial data (Yahoo Finance, FRED API) would be more reliable
- Real-time options data to calculate implied volatility more precisely
- Historical question resolution data to calibrate for this type of question

## 4. Reasoning Quality

### Strongest Evidence
1. VXN at 19.49% - direct market pricing of expected volatility
2. 8 trading days is short - limits range of likely outcomes
3. Recent price action (Jan 26-30): 25,713-26,022 range, 1.8% drop in 2 days
4. Heavy earnings week (Amazon, Alphabet) but effects uncertain

### Key Uncertainties
- Earnings reactions from Amazon/Alphabet could move index 3-5%
- Government shutdown may affect market sentiment
- DeepSeek AI concerns have created uncertainty in tech

### "Nothing Ever Happens" Check
For numeric index predictions, this principle applies as: the index is unlikely to move dramatically in 8 trading days absent a major shock. My 80% CI of ±~6% from current is consistent with VXN-implied volatility, which seems reasonable.

## 5. Process Improvements

### What Worked
- Starting with quantitative framework (volatility → distribution)
- Monte Carlo simulation for verification
- Checking specific near-term catalysts

### For Next Time
- Get more granular historical volatility data
- Check for similar past questions and their resolution patterns
- Consider regime-switching (calm markets vs volatile markets)

## 6. Calibration Notes

**Confidence Level**: Moderate-high for the distribution shape, less certain about exact percentiles

**Update Triggers**:
- Major earnings miss from Amazon or Alphabet (would shift distribution left ~3-5%)
- Geopolitical shock or Fed surprise
- Resolution of government shutdown (mild positive)

**Comparable Forecasts**: This is similar to short-term index forecasts where VXN/VIX provides good guidance.

## 7. System Design Reflection

### Tool Gaps
I wished for direct financial data API access. Having to scrape web pages for current prices adds latency and uncertainty. A tool like `get_financial_data(ticker, date_range)` would be valuable.

### Subagent Friction
For this question, I didn't need subagents - the straightforward quantitative approach was sufficient. Deep research would have been overkill for an 8-day horizon.

### Prompt Assumptions
The numeric question guidance was helpful - the checklist of considerations (time left, trend, scenarios) matched this task well.

### From Scratch Design
For financial time series forecasts:
1. **Financial data tool**: Direct API access to Yahoo Finance, FRED, etc.
2. **Options data tool**: Get implied volatility from options markets
3. **Historical distribution tool**: Past question resolutions for calibration
4. **Scenario analyzer**: Given news/events, estimate impact on distribution
