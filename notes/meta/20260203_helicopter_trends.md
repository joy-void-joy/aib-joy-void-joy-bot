# Meta Reflection: Helicopter Google Trends Question

**Question**: Will interest in "helicopter" change between 2026-02-03 and 2026-02-14?
**Date**: 2026-02-03

## Executive Summary
Forecasting Google Trends change for "helicopter" search term. The key driver is the NTSB Potomac crash hearing on Jan 27, 2026, which likely elevated searches. Expect decay pattern over the 11-day window.

## Research Conducted
1. Web search for recent helicopter news - found NTSB Potomac hearing (Jan 27), Arizona crash (Jan 2), Israel helicopter sale (Jan 30-31)
2. Web search for scheduled helicopter events - found International Military Helicopter conference Feb 24-26 (outside window)
3. Wikipedia summary of Potomac collision for context
4. Polymarket search (no relevant markets)

## Key Findings
- NTSB Potomac hearing on Jan 27, 2026 was major news event
- Current value 60 on Feb 1 suggests elevated interest from news coverage
- No scheduled events Feb 3-14 to drive increased searches
- News interest typically decays with ~3-7 day half-life

## Reasoning Quality Check

**Strongest evidence FOR "Decreases":**
1. NTSB story will be 7-18 days old during measurement window - decay expected
2. No scheduled helicopter events to spike interest
3. News cycles move on quickly

**Strongest argument AGAINST "Decreases":**
- Unpredictable events (new crash, political developments)
- ±3 threshold is narrow - could stay within band
- Ongoing coverage of FAA/Army failures could sustain interest

**Question type**: Measurement (Google Trends value)
- Applied news decay model rather than "Nothing Ever Happens"
- Calibration check: News decay is well-established pattern

## Final Forecast
- Decreases: 45%
- Doesn't change: 35%
- Increases: 20%
