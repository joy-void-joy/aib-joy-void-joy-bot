  "summary": "New START expires Feb 5, 2026 with no formal extension or replacement agreement in sight",
  "content": "Key findings:\n1. New START expires February 5, 2026. The treaty's provisions do NOT allow for a further formal extension (the one-time 5-year extension clause was already used in 2021).\n2. Russia suspended participation in Feb 2023; US followed suit.\n3. Putin proposed voluntary one-year extension of central limits in Sept 2025. Trump said it \"sounds like a good idea\" but NO formal negotiations followed.\n4. As of Jan 2026, Moscow indicated it \"no longer has clear interlocutors within the US administration\" to reach out to.\n5. Chatham House (Jan 26, 2026): Treaty is \"due to expire\" with no indication of extension.\n6. RFE/RL (Jan 8, 2026): \"No indications that an 11th-hour extension to the central terms of the treaty is coming.\"\n7. New Scientist (Dec 30, 2025): \"A replacement is unlikely\" - experts broadly agree.\n8. The question closes Feb 1, 2026 and resolves Feb 5, 2026 - only 4 days remain.\n9. Even if both sides wanted to extend, the treaty mechanism doesn't allow another formal extension. A replacement treaty would need to be negotiated and described as a \"successor\" by US officials, Russian officials, AND other credible sources.",
