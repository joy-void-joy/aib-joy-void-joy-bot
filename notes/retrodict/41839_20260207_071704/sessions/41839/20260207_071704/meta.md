# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Post ID 8393: "Will the New START nuclear arms control agreement be renewed until at least February 5, 2027, before February 5, 2026?"
Final forecast: ~1% (NO). This is an extremely clear-cut case. The treaty expires in 4 days, no formal extension mechanism exists (already used in 2021), no replacement treaty has been negotiated, and multiple expert sources confirm no last-minute deal is forthcoming.

## Research Audit
- **search_exa** (multiple rounds): Very valuable. Found Chatham House analysis from Jan 26, 2026, RFE/RL from Jan 8, Arms Control Association from Oct 2025, and New Scientist from Dec 2025. All consistently report no extension coming.
- **get_metaculus_questions**: Useful for confirming resolution criteria.
- **polymarket_price**: No markets found on this topic.
- **WebFetch**: Failed repeatedly (web.archive.org redirect issues). Minor impact since Exa snippets were sufficient.
- **CP history**: 404 error, possibly because this is an AIB tournament question.

## Reasoning Quality Check

*Strongest evidence FOR my forecast (NO):*
1. Treaty's formal extension mechanism already exhausted in 2021 - cannot be extended again under its own terms
2. Russia suspended participation in 2023; no resumed inspections or data exchange
3. Multiple expert sources (Chatham House Jan 26, RFE/RL Jan 8, New Scientist Dec 30) all confirm no extension coming
4. Moscow says it has "no clear interlocutors" in the US administration
5. Only 4 days remain - even in the best case, a replacement treaty would take months/years to negotiate

*Strongest argument AGAINST my forecast:*
- A hypothetical secret back-channel deal announced at the last minute. But this would require: (a) a new treaty framework since the extension clause is exhausted, (b) both sides describing it as a "successor," (c) Senate ratification or at least executive agreement. None of these are remotely plausible in 4 days.

*Calibration check:*
- Question type: Predictive, but essentially resolved by the status quo
- "Nothing Ever Happens" strongly applies - even supportive rhetoric from Trump didn't translate to action
- My 1% accounts for the near-zero but non-zero chance of a surprise announcement

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents. The question is straightforward with overwhelming evidence pointing one direction. No need for parallel research threads.

## Tool Effectiveness
- search_exa: Excellent, found all key sources
- WebFetch: Failed (redirect to web.archive.org) - actual tool failure
- polymarket: No results found (not a failure, just no relevant markets)
- CP history: 404 error - possible tool issue with AIB tournament questions

## Process Feedback
- The "Nothing Ever Happens" heuristic is perfectly aligned here
- For questions this close to resolution with overwhelming evidence, minimal research is appropriate

## Calibration Tracking
- 99% confident this resolves NO
- Update trigger: Only a surprise announcement of a formal successor treaty in the next 4 days would change this
