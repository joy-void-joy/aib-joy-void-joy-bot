  "summary": "North Korea is unlikely to conduct a nuclear test before May 1, 2026. While Tunnel No. 3 at Punggye-ri has been ready since 2022 and NK is technically capable of testing at any time, the last nuclear test was in September 2017 (8+ years ago), and satellite imagery as of November 2025 showed no signs of imminent test preparations. NK's current focus is on missile testing and an upcoming party congress. The historical base rate is ~2.7%/month, but the prolonged period of readiness without testing reveals a strong political preference against nuclear testing at this time. The 3-month window is short and \"Nothing Ever Happens\" applies strongly.",
