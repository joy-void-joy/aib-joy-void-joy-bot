  "summary": "North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test since September 2017 — over 8 years ago. While Tunnel No. 3 at Punggye-ri has been ready since ~2020, November 2025 satellite imagery shows no signs of imminent test preparations (no instruments, power lines, or cables). The diplomatic environment further suppresses testing likelihood: Trump has dropped denuclearization as a stated goal and signals willingness for engagement with Kim Jong Un, creating a disincentive for provocative nuclear testing. Kim is focused on missile production and testing, not nuclear detonations. The 3-month window is short, and North Korea has repeatedly been assessed as \"ready\" for years without testing. Applying \"Nothing Ever Happens\" calibration to the raw base rate (~2.7%/month) and accounting for the restraint pattern and diplomatic context yields a low probability.",
