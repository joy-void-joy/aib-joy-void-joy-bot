  "summary": "North Korea has been technically ready to conduct a 7th nuclear test since at least 2022 (Tunnel No. 3 at Punggye-ri is operational), but has chosen not to for 8+ years since September 2017. The unconditional base rate is ~2.6%/month (~7.7% over 3 months), but multiple factors reduce this: November 2025 satellite imagery shows no imminent test preparations (no instruments, power lines, vehicles, or personnel), North Korea's military focus has been on missile testing and production rather than nuclear testing, and the 8+ year pause despite readiness indicates political constraints are the binding factor. The Workers' Party Congress in February 2026 and escalating nuclear rhetoric provide some upside risk, but diplomatic considerations (stalled Trump-Kim talks, Russia/China relationships) and the absence of concrete preparation indicators keep probability low.",
