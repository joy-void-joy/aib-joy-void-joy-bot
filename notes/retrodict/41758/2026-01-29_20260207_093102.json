  "summary": "North Korea has been technically ready for a 7th nuclear test since mid-2022 (Tunnel No. 3 at Punggye-ri), and South Korean intelligence confirmed in Nov 2025 that only Kim's political decision is needed. However, despite years of readiness, NK has not tested since September 2017 - a moratorium of over 8 years. As of Nov 2025, satellite imagery showed no visible preparations (no instruments, cables, or vehicles) at the test site. NK's current focus is on missile production, delivery systems, and submarine development. The upcoming party congress may announce nuclear plans, but rhetoric has not translated to testing for years. The Trump engagement opportunity and NK-Russia relationship may further incentivize restraint. Multiple prior Metaculus questions on NK nuclear testing have resolved No. The 3-month window is short, and \"Nothing Ever Happens\" applies strongly here.",
