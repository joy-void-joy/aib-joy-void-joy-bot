  "summary": "The January 2026 FOMC meeting will have different voting dynamics than December 2025 due to the rotation of regional Fed presidents. Two key December dissenters (Schmid and Goolsbee) are rotating off, replaced by Logan (very hawkish), Hammack (neutral), Kashkari (neutral/hawkish), and Paulson (dovish). However, Stephen Miran remains as a permanent voter and has dissented at every meeting since his appointment (September, October, December 2025), consistently wanting faster rate cuts. With the Fed expected to hold rates in January, Miran is highly likely to dissent again. The most probable outcome is 1 dissent (Miran alone), with moderate probability of 2 dissents if the dovish Paulson joins him. The probability of 0 dissents is low given Miran's consistent pattern, while 3+ is less likely since the most frequent dissenters have rotated off.",
