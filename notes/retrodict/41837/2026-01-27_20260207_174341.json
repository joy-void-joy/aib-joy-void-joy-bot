  "summary": "This question is very unlikely to resolve YES. The key barriers are: (1) No model has self-reported a GPQA Diamond score of 94% or higher - the ceiling is 93.8% from Gemini 3 Deep Think; (2) Epoch's leaderboard hasn't been updated past 92.6% despite newer models being available for months; (3) Only ~4 days remain, insufficient for a new model release + independent Epoch evaluation + leaderboard update. The community prediction has dropped to ~1-5%, reflecting strong consensus. The only slim possibility is Epoch evaluating Gemini 3 Deep Think and getting a score slightly higher than the self-reported 93.8%, but this would require both the evaluation happening and the result crossing 94.0% - both unlikely given the short timeframe and narrow margin.",
