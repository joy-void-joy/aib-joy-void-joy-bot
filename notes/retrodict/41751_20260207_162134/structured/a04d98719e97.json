  "summary": "LATAM and APAC have been at near-parity throughout 2025. APAC grows faster but gap is narrowing. From equal Q1 2025 base (~$1.26B each), APAC's persistent growth advantage favors it slightly for Q1 2026.",
  "content": "Key data points:\n- Q1 2025: Both ~$1.26B (LATAM 8% YoY, APAC 23% YoY)\n- Q2 2025: Both ~$1.31B (LATAM 9% YoY, APAC 24% YoY)\n- Q3 2025: LATAM $1,370,913K vs APAC $1,368,561K (LATAM ahead by $2.35M)\n- Q4 2025: Both ~$1.42B (LATAM 15% YoY, APAC 17% YoY)\n\nGrowth gap narrowing: 15pp → 15pp → 11pp → 2pp\nAPAC still growing faster despite deceleration\nLATAM accelerating (8% → 15%)\n\nProjection for Q1 2026: If APAC maintains even 1-2pp growth advantage from equal $1.26B base, APAC wins by ~$15-25M. But FX uncertainty and convergence of growth rates creates meaningful LATAM possibility.",
