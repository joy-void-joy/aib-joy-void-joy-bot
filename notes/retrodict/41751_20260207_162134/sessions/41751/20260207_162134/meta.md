# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Netflix LATAM vs APAC Q1 2026 revenue comparison. My final forecast: APAC 55%, LATAM 44%, Tie 1%.

The two regions have been remarkably close throughout 2025, with revenues within $2-3M of each other in Q3 2025 (the most precise data point). APAC has consistently grown faster than LATAM, though the gap is narrowing. From an essentially equal base in Q1 2025 (~$1.26B each), APAC's persistent growth advantage slightly favors it.

## Research Audit
- company_financials(NFLX, quarterly) - useful for total revenue context but doesn't break out by region
- search_exa for Q4 2025, Q3 2025, Q2 2025, Q1 2025 earnings - VERY useful, gave regional breakdowns
- The Q3 2025 10-Q fine print in the question itself was critical (exact LATAM vs APAC figures)
- polymarket_price - no relevant markets found

Most informative: TheWrap earnings articles with regional revenue breakdowns for each quarter

## Reasoning Quality Check

Strongest evidence FOR my forecast (APAC slightly favored):
1. APAC has grown faster than LATAM every quarter in 2025
2. From essentially equal base in Q1 2025, faster growth = higher revenue
3. The trend from Q3 (LATAM barely ahead) to Q4 (tied) suggests APAC is overtaking

Strongest argument AGAINST:
- Growth rate gap narrowed dramatically (15pp → 2pp) - could fully converge or reverse
- FX movements could swing things either way (Latin American currencies vs Asian currencies)
- LATAM's accelerating growth (8% → 15%) could potentially match or exceed APAC's decelerating growth
- We don't have exact Q1 2025 base figures - LATAM could have been slightly higher

Calibration check:
- This is a measurement/comparison question - predicting which of two very close quantities will be larger
- "Nothing Ever Happens" doesn't really apply here - one WILL be higher
- Given how close they are, significant uncertainty is warranted
- 55/44/1 seems well calibrated for this level of uncertainty

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents. The question is relatively straightforward - comparing two regional revenue figures based on recent trend data. The main challenge is that the exact numbers aren't publicly available yet.

## Tool Effectiveness
- company_financials: Useful but doesn't provide regional breakdown
- search_exa: Very effective for finding earnings report details with regional revenue
- polymarket_price: No relevant markets (expected for this niche question)
- execute_code: Helpful for scenario analysis

## Process Feedback
- The quarterly earnings reports provided good regional data
- Would have been ideal to access the actual 10-Q filings for exact figures
- The convergence analysis was the most valuable part of the research

## Calibration Tracking
- Confidence: ~55% APAC, moderate uncertainty
- If I saw Q4 2025 10-Q showing APAC clearly ahead, I'd move to 60-65% APAC
- If I saw LATAM growth continuing to accelerate past APAC, I'd move to 55% LATAM
