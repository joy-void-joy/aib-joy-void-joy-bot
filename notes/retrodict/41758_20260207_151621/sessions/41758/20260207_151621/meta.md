# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Post ID: 41758. Question: Will North Korea conduct a nuclear test before May 1, 2026?
Final forecast: ~5% probability (low).
Approach: Base rate analysis from historical tests, updated with satellite imagery intelligence, diplomatic context, and "Nothing Ever Happens" adjustment.

## Research Audit
- Metaculus question search: Found multiple related NK nuclear test questions (28903, 39006, 39530) - all appear to have resolved No
- Exa search on Punggye-ri satellite imagery: Very informative - found Nov 2025 Daily NK analysis showing no imminent indicators
- Exa search on Trump-Kim diplomacy: Found NK rejection of talks, stalled diplomacy
- Exa search on NK military activity: Found heavy missile testing focus but no nuclear test signals
- Polymarket: No active market found
- Manifold: Found conditional market but not directly applicable
- CP history tool returned not found (AIB tournament question)

## Reasoning Quality Check

*Strongest evidence FOR my forecast (low probability):*
1. No satellite indicators of imminent test preparations as of Nov 2025
2. 8+ year gap since last test despite technical readiness since 2022 suggests political constraints
3. Historical base rate for 3-month window is only ~7.7% unconditional

*Strongest argument AGAINST my forecast:*
- Workers' Party Congress in Feb 2026 could be occasion for dramatic nuclear demonstration
- Kim has been escalating rhetoric about nuclear force expansion
- A smart disagreer might say the Party Congress creates a specific political incentive to test

*Calibration check:*
- Question type: Predictive
- Applied "Nothing Ever Happens" skepticism: Yes, nuclear tests are dramatic/newsworthy events
- The 8-year hiatus despite readiness is itself the strongest evidence for continued non-testing
- 80% CI for my probability estimate: [3%, 12%]

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents. The question is relatively straightforward with clear factors. Main thread research was sufficient.

## Tool Effectiveness
- search_exa: Very effective, found relevant recent analysis
- search_metaculus: Useful for finding related historical questions
- get_metaculus_questions: Worked well for question details
- polymarket_price: No results found (not a failure, just no market)
- get_cp_history: ID not found (expected for AIB tournament)

## Process Feedback
- The "Nothing Ever Happens" guidance was directly applicable here
- Base rate calculation was straightforward and useful as an anchor
- The satellite imagery intelligence was the single most informative finding

## Calibration Tracking
- 80% CI: [3%, 12%]
- I'm about 85% confident in this forecast being in the right range
- Update triggers: +20% if satellite imagery shows active test preparations; +10% if Party Congress announces nuclear test plans; -3% if diplomatic engagement resumes
