# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Post ID: 41882. Question: Which party will win the most seats in the 2026 Nepali House of Representatives election?
Final forecast: NC ~34%, RSP ~23%, CPN-UML ~21%, NCP ~14%, RPP ~4%, others ~4%.
Confidence: Moderate. Nepal's fragmented multi-party system with FPTP makes this genuinely uncertain.

## Research Audit
- Wikipedia article for the 2026 election was the most informative source - full candidate lists, party information, structural details
- Exa searches yielded good contextual articles about Balen Shah/RSP, NCP merger, Gen Z protests
- Web search found the critical voter survey showing 60% want new parties
- Could not access Kalshi market data (WebFetch errors)
- No Polymarket or Manifold markets found for this question

## Reasoning Quality Check

*Strongest evidence FOR NC winning most seats:*
1. Left vote split between CPN-UML and NCP strongly benefits NC in FPTP (this was the pattern in 2022 when NC won most seats despite lower PR vote share)
2. NC has deepest organizational infrastructure, new energized leadership under Gagan Thapa
3. NC won most seats in the recent National Assembly election (Jan 2026)
4. Anti-incumbency against Oli/CPN-UML (was PM during Gen Z protests)

*Strongest argument AGAINST my forecast:*
- The voter survey showing 60% want new parties could indicate a much larger RSP surge than I'm estimating
- Balen Shah is a genuinely transformative figure; if the youth vote materializes at scale, RSP could win the most seats
- I may be underweighting the Gen Z movement's impact on voter behavior

*Calibration check:*
- Question type: Predictive (multi-party election)
- Applied FPTP structural advantage for established parties as a key consideration
- Applied "Nothing Ever Happens" by noting that new parties rarely win the most seats in their first/second election
- Uncertainty is high - this is a genuinely fragmented race

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents. The question is well-defined and research was sufficient with direct tools. Subagents would have added overhead without significant benefit.

## Tool Effectiveness
- Wikipedia (full article mode) was excellent - provided comprehensive candidate lists and party details
- Exa search worked well for contextual articles
- WebFetch had repeated failures (unable to fetch from web.archive.org - seems like Wikipedia URLs were being redirected)
- Polymarket/Manifold had no markets for this topic
- Web search found the key voter survey

## Process Feedback
- For South Asian elections, opinion polling data is sparse and hard to find
- The FPTP vs PR dual system adds significant complexity
- The lack of market data for this question means I'm relying more on structural analysis

## Calibration Tracking
- 80% CI: NC wins most seats with probability between 25-45%
- Update triggers: Any opinion polls showing RSP leading, any major candidate withdrawals, any election postponement news
