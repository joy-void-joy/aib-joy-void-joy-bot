# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Post ID: 41882 (synced from original). Title: Which party will win the most seats in the 2026 Nepali House of Representatives election?
Final forecast: NC 33%, UML 22%, RSP 18%, NCP 14%, RPP 4%, small parties/other ~9%
Moderate confidence. This is a genuinely uncertain multi-party election with unprecedented dynamics (Gen Z protests).

## Research Audit
- Searched for election details, party dynamics, alliances, polling data, and analyst assessments
- Most informative: Wikipedia election page (party standings, candidacy numbers), Kathmandu Post articles on RSP growth and alliance dynamics, and the article on NC-UML sweeping upper house polls
- No prediction markets found (Polymarket/Manifold empty for Nepal)
- No formal opinion polls found - Nepal doesn't have robust polling infrastructure like Western democracies
- The NC-UML alliance being ONLY for National Assembly (not HoR) was a critical finding

## Reasoning Quality Check

*Strongest evidence FOR my forecast (NC as plurality winner):*
1. NC won most seats in 2022 (89), has strongest organizational depth across all 165 constituencies
2. FPTP system heavily favors established parties with deep local networks
3. Left vote split 3 ways (UML, NCP, RSP draws anti-establishment left) benefits centrist NC
4. New younger leader (Gagan Thapa) partially addresses anti-incumbency

*Strongest argument AGAINST:*
- Gen Z protests created unprecedented anti-establishment sentiment that could fundamentally reshape voting patterns
- RSP's merger with Balen Shah (hugely popular among youth) could be transformative
- A smart disagreer would say I'm anchoring too heavily on 2022 results and underweighting the seismic shift from Gen Z protests

*Calibration check:*
- Question type: Predictive (multiple choice)
- Applied "Nothing Ever Happens" skepticism to RSP's dramatic rise claims
- Nepal elections are genuinely hard to predict - multi-party FPTP with fluid coalitions
- I'm ~60% confident the true winner is among my top 2 (NC or UML)

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents. The question, while complex, was manageable with direct research. The main challenge was lack of polling data, which subagents couldn't solve either.

## Tool Effectiveness
- search_exa: Very useful, found relevant Kathmandu Post and other Nepal news articles
- Wikipedia fetch: Failed due to redirect, but exa search results included Wikipedia snippets
- Polymarket/Manifold: No markets found (expected for Nepal election)
- No actual failures, just absence of prediction market data

## Process Feedback
- Nepal election data is sparse compared to Western elections - no proper polling
- Had to rely heavily on qualitative analysis and historical precedent
- The 2022 results provide the strongest quantitative anchor

## Calibration Tracking
- 80% CI for NC probability: [20%, 45%]
- Update triggers: Any formal opinion poll data, significant alliance shifts, major campaign events
