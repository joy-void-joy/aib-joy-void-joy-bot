  "summary": "Netflix LATAM and APAC revenues have been remarkably close throughout 2025, with both regions generating nearly identical quarterly revenue (~$1.26B in Q1, ~$1.31B in Q2, ~$1.37B in Q3, ~$1.42B in Q4). In Q3 2025, the most precise data point (from the 10-Q), LATAM led by just $2.35M. However, APAC has consistently grown faster than LATAM every quarter (23% vs 8% in Q1, 17% vs 15% in Q4), though the gap is narrowing. From an essentially equal base in Q1 2025 (~$1.26B each), APAC's persistent growth advantage suggests it should edge ahead in Q1 2026. However, the convergence of growth rates and FX uncertainty create meaningful probability for either outcome. A tie (exact same dollar amount) is virtually impossible given reporting precision to thousands of dollars.",
