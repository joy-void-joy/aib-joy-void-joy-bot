  "summary": "Netflix's LATAM and APAC revenues have been converging throughout 2025, reaching a dead tie in Q1 2025 ($1.26B each), with LATAM barely ahead in Q3 2025 ($1,371M vs $1,369M), and APAC overtaking LATAM for the first time in Q4 2025 ($1,421M vs $1,418M). APAC has consistently higher reported USD growth rates (17-23% vs 8-15%), driven by subscriber expansion in India, Japan, and Korea. However, FX-neutral growth rates are nearly identical (LATAM 20% vs APAC 19% in Q4 2025), meaning the difference is largely FX-driven. The BRL has been strengthening in January 2026 (from ~5.5 to 5.28 vs USD), which creates a LATAM tailwind. Given the razor-thin margin ($3M on $1.4B revenue, <0.2%), this is close to a coin flip, with APAC having a slight structural edge from its recent crossover and reported growth momentum.",
