# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Question: Will OpenAI release GPT-6 for general public availability before May 1, 2026?
Final forecast: ~3% probability (very unlikely)
Approach: Researched current OpenAI model release cadence, checked prediction markets, reviewed official statements from Sam Altman and OpenAI.

## Research Audit
- search_exa queries on GPT-6 release dates, OpenAI model timeline were highly informative
- Manifold Markets provided excellent calibration data (~17% for June 1, 2026 deadline)
- Found that OpenAI is still on GPT-5.3-Codex as of Feb 5, 2026
- No Polymarket markets found for this specific question

## Reasoning Quality Check

Strongest evidence FOR low probability:
1. OpenAI just released GPT-5.3-Codex (Feb 5, 2026), showing active GPT-5.x iteration
2. No GPT-6 announcement or preview has been made
3. Manifold market for GPT-6 before June 1 is only 17%
4. OpenAI acknowledged compute capacity constraints

Strongest argument AGAINST my forecast (i.e., why it might happen):
- Sam Altman said gap between GPT-5 and GPT-6 would be shorter
- OpenAI could surprise with an accelerated release
- Competitive pressure from Google, Anthropic, xAI

Calibration: This is a predictive question. "Nothing Ever Happens" applies strongly - product releases almost always slip, and there's no concrete evidence of imminent GPT-6. My 3% accounts for tail probability of a surprise announcement + rapid rollout.

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents - straightforward question where sequential searches in main thread were sufficient.

## Tool Effectiveness
- search_exa: Very useful, found key articles and OpenAI release notes
- manifold_price: Excellent calibration reference
- polymarket_price: No results found (not a failure, just no markets)

## Process Feedback
- The "Nothing Ever Happens" framework was appropriate here
- Market data from Manifold was the strongest anchoring signal

## Calibration Tracking
- 95% CI: [1%, 10%]
- Key update trigger: If OpenAI announces GPT-6 or a preview/beta, probability would jump significantly
