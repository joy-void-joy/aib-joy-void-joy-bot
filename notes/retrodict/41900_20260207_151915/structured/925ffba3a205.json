  "content": "Key findings:\n1. OpenAI confirmed GPT-6 will NOT launch in 2025\n2. Sam Altman said gap between GPT-5 and GPT-6 will be shorter than GPT-4 to GPT-5 gap\n3. Early speculation: private previews mid-2026, public release later 2026 or early 2027\n4. Some sources say \"first half of 2026\" for most likely release\n5. As of Feb 2026, OpenAI is on GPT-5.3-Codex (released Feb 5, 2026), GPT-5.1 released Nov 2025\n6. OpenAI has acknowledged capacity constraints - better models ready but can't deploy due to insufficient compute\n7. Manifold market for \"GPT-6 before June 1, 2026\" is at ~17% probability\n8. Manifold market for \"GPT-6 released in 2026\" is at ~76%\n9. No GPT-6 announcement or release has happened as of early Feb 2026\n10. OpenAI is still iterating on GPT-5.x series (5.1, 5.3-Codex)",
