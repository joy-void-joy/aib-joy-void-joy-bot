  "summary": "The BOJ held rates at 0.75% at its January 22-23 meeting. Two more meetings fall before May 1: March (~mid-March) and April 27-28. A Reuters poll (Jan 15) shows 97% of economists expect no change through March, and the consensus timing for the next hike is July 2026. However, a CNBC sources article (Jan 16) reveals some BOJ policymakers see April as \"a distinct possibility,\" driven by yen weakness and broadening inflation. The yen is currently at ~152, well below the 160 level Citigroup cites as a trigger for an early hike. Spring wage negotiation results and the April 1 BOJ business survey will be key data available before the April meeting. Political uncertainty from the Feb 8 snap election adds near-term caution. The combined probability of a hike at either the March (~3%) or April (~30%) meeting is roughly 32%.",
