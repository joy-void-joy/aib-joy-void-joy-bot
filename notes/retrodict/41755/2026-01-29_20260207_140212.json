  "summary": "The BOJ is at 0.75% after its December 2025 hike and held steady in January 2026. Two meetings fall in the resolution window: March (~mid-March) and April 27-28. The analyst consensus (Reuters poll) is that the next hike comes in July 2026, with >75% expecting rates at 1%+ by September. However, BOJ insiders have leaked that April is \"a distinct possibility,\" board member Takata dissented in January wanting to hike to 1%, and spring wage data (shunto) plus the April 1 Tankan survey will be available by the April meeting. Counterbalancing this: PM Takaichi is a fiscal dove who may pressure BOJ to delay, a February snap election adds political uncertainty, and market pricing (OIS) suggests less than one full hike within 12 months. The April 27-28 meeting is the most likely candidate for a hike within the window, but it remains a minority probability scenario.",
