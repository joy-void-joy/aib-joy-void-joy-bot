  "summary": "The BOJ is on a clear hiking trajectory but the question asks about a narrow window (effectively the March meeting, with the April meeting's inclusion uncertain). The analyst consensus expects the next hike in July 2026, not March. However, hawkish BOJ signals (Ueda calling rates \"extremely low,\" Takata dissenting for an immediate hike, internal views favoring sooner moves) create meaningful upside risk. The spring wage negotiation results (due mid-March) and yen dynamics are key catalysts. Political pressure from PM Takaichi favoring loose policy is a headwind but hasn't stopped the BOJ before (they hiked in December despite her). I estimate ~15-20% probability for a March hike and ~10-15% for an April hike falling within the window, yielding an overall ~35% probability.",
