# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Post ID 41758: "Will North Korea conduct a nuclear test before May 1, 2026?"
Final forecast: ~5% probability (low)
Approach: Combined base rate analysis, satellite imagery evidence, diplomatic context, and "Nothing Ever Happens" calibration.

## Research Audit
- Exa searches (3 rounds) were highly productive - found satellite imagery analysis, diplomatic context, and expert assessments
- Metaculus search found related resolved questions (before 2025, before 2026 versions)
- Polymarket had no markets on this; Manifold had only a conditional question
- No community prediction available (AIB tournament)

Most informative sources:
1. Daily NK satellite imagery analysis (Nov 2025) showing no imminent test signs
2. CNN article on record-length nuclear test hiatus (Jan 2026)
3. SCMP on Trump dropping denuclearization goal (Dec 2025)
4. Chatham House analysis of 2026 NK diplomatic prospects

## Reasoning Quality Check

*Strongest evidence FOR my forecast (low probability):*
1. No satellite evidence of imminent preparations despite 8+ years of readiness
2. Diplomatic window with Trump creates disincentive for provocative testing
3. NK has been "ready" since 2020 but hasn't tested - pattern of restraint despite capability

*Strongest argument AGAINST my forecast:*
- A smart disagreer might say: "NK has been building pressure with missile tests and Kim could use the party congress to announce/coincide with a nuclear test for maximum domestic impact"
- Evidence that would change my mind: satellite imagery showing instrument installation at Tunnel No. 3, breakdown in US-DPRK diplomatic signals

*Calibration check:*
- Question type: Predictive
- Applied "Nothing Ever Happens" - NK has been predicted to test imminently for years and hasn't
- Short 3-month window further constrains probability
- My 5% feels right given base rate (~8% raw for 3 months) discounted by diplomatic context and absence of imminent preparations

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents - question was straightforward enough to research in main thread with parallel searches. Correct decision.

## Tool Effectiveness
- search_exa: Excellent, found all key sources
- search_metaculus: Found relevant historical questions
- polymarket/manifold: No useful markets available (not a failure, just no relevant markets)
- get_prediction_history: No prior forecasts (expected for new question)

## Process Feedback
- The prompt guidance on "Nothing Ever Happens" was highly relevant here
- Base rate calculation from the Metaculus question background was useful context
- Diplomatic context research was essential for this geopolitical question

## Calibration Tracking
- 80% CI: [2%, 10%]
- Update triggers: +10% if satellite shows test prep activity; +15% if diplomacy collapses; -3% if Trump-Kim summit announced
