# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Post ID: 41339. Forecasting the inaugural Best Traditional Country Album at the 2026 Grammys. The ceremony took place on Feb 1, 2026 (before today, Feb 7), but I was unable to find the actual winner through my search tools - Wikipedia and other sources have data cutoffs before the ceremony. Rolling Stone predicted Zach Top as the winner. My forecast assigns ~35% to Zach Top, ~25% to Charley Crockett, ~18% to Willie Nelson, ~13% to Margo Price, and ~9% to Lukas Nelson.

## Research Audit
- **get_metaculus_questions**: Confirmed nominees and question details - useful
- **search_exa**: Found Rolling Stone prediction article (key evidence), Grammy.com nominee details, and category background - very useful
- **wikipedia**: Found category creation context and that winners hadn't been updated yet - partially useful
- **web_search**: Mostly empty results for post-ceremony data - limited utility
- **WebFetch**: All attempts failed due to web.archive.org redirect issue - not useful
- **polymarket/manifold**: No markets found for this question

## Reasoning Quality Check

*Strongest evidence FOR Zach Top:*
1. Rolling Stone explicitly predicted him as the winner
2. Most nominations (3) of any artist in this category
3. Described as making "traditional country cool again" - strong narrative

*Strongest argument AGAINST Zach Top:*
- First-time award categories can be unpredictable
- The Academy might want to honor a veteran like Willie Nelson or an artist specifically named as the reason for the category (Charley Crockett)
- Rolling Stone's pre-nomination predictions don't always match actual winners

*Calibration check:*
- This is a predictive question about a specific event that has already occurred (but I can't access the result)
- My uncertainty is genuine since I lack the actual result
- The question closed on Jan 6 before the ceremony, so this was indeed a prediction question

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents - this is a relatively straightforward prediction question where the main task was finding expert predictions and nominee analysis. Sequential searches were sufficient.

## Tool Effectiveness
- search_exa was the most valuable tool, finding the Rolling Stone prediction article
- Wikipedia tool had stale data (pre-ceremony revision)
- WebFetch consistently failed due to redirect issues
- web_search returned very limited results for 2026 Grammy winners
- No prediction markets existed for this specific question

## Process Feedback
- The inability to access post-ceremony results is a significant limitation
- For questions about events that have already occurred, having access to more recent web data would dramatically improve accuracy
- The Rolling Stone article was the single most informative source

## Calibration Tracking
- Confidence: ~35% on Zach Top as favorite (moderate)
- This reflects genuine uncertainty about a 5-way race with one clear frontrunner
- If I could access post-ceremony data, this would resolve definitively
