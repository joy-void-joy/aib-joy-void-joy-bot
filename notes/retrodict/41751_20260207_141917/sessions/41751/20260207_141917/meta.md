# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Question about Netflix Q1 2026 LATAM vs APAC revenue comparison. My final forecast: APAC 55%, LATAM 44%, Tie 1%. This is a near coin-flip question given the razor-thin margins between the two regions.

## Research Audit
- **company_financials (NFLX)**: Provided total revenue but not regional breakdown — limited value for this specific question
- **search_exa (Q3 2025 10-Q)**: Found Q3 2025 regional data confirming LATAM $1,371M vs APAC $1,369M
- **search_exa (Q4 2025 earnings)**: Critical finding — APAC overtook LATAM for the first time at $1,421M vs $1,418M
- **search_exa (Q1 2025 earnings)**: Found Q1 2025 data showing dead tie at $1.26B each
- **stock_history (BRL=X)**: BRL strengthening from ~5.5 to 5.28 in Jan 2026 — relevant FX factor
- **businessofapps data**: Historical annual data showing LATAM consistently ahead until 2025

## Reasoning Quality Check

*Strongest evidence FOR my forecast (slight APAC edge):*
1. APAC just overtook LATAM in the most recent quarter (Q4 2025) — $1,421M vs $1,418M
2. APAC has consistently higher reported (USD) growth rates throughout 2025
3. Structural APAC growth momentum (India subscriber expansion, Korean content)

*Strongest argument AGAINST my forecast:*
- FX-neutral growth is nearly identical (LATAM 20% vs APAC 19% in Q4 2025), and the BRL is strengthening into Q1 2026, which could give LATAM a tailwind in reported USD revenues
- A smart disagreer would note that the margin is so thin ($3M on $1.4B) that FX effects dominate, and BRL appreciation could easily swing this back to LATAM

*Calibration check:*
- Question type: Predictive (which region will be higher)
- The uncertainty is genuinely high — this is close to a coin flip with a slight structural tilt toward APAC
- I'm about 60% confident APAC leads, but acknowledge significant FX uncertainty

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents — the data needed was straightforward (Netflix earnings reports) and findable with direct searches. No need for parallel research threads.

## Tool Effectiveness
- search_exa was the most valuable tool, finding exact quarterly regional breakdowns
- company_financials didn't provide regional segmentation, which is a limitation
- stock_history on BRL=X provided useful FX context
- No tool failures encountered

## Process Feedback
- The question resolution hinges on a very small margin ($2-3M), making FX effects the dominant uncertainty
- Historical pattern analysis was essential to understand the convergence trend

## Calibration Tracking
- 80% CI: APAC 40-70%, LATAM 29-59%
- Update triggers: Major BRL/LATAM currency move, APAC-specific headwind (regulatory in India/Korea)
