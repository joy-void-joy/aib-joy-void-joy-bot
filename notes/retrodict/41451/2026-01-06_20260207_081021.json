  "summary": "This is the inaugural Best Traditional Country Album award at the 2026 Grammys (Feb 1, 2026). I was unable to confirm the actual winner despite the ceremony having already occurred. Based on pre-ceremony evidence, Zach Top is the frontrunner per Rolling Stone's explicit prediction and his 3 Grammy nominations (most of any nominee in this category). He's described as making \"traditional country cool again.\" Charley Crockett is a strong second \u2014 the Academy specifically named him when explaining why this category was created. Willie Nelson has a sentimental/legend factor. Margo Price and Lukas Nelson are longer shots. The category was created to serve underrepresented traditional country artists, which favors Crockett and Top over established names.",
