  "summary": "GPT-6 general public release before May 1, 2026 is very unlikely. As of early February 2026, OpenAI is still actively iterating on the GPT-5.x series (GPT-5.3-Codex released Feb 5, 2026). No GPT-6 has been announced, previewed, or even entered closed beta. Most credible speculation points to mid-to-late 2026 for GPT-6, with private previews possibly in mid-2026 and public release later. OpenAI has also acknowledged compute capacity constraints. The Manifold market for GPT-6 before June 1, 2026 (a full month later than our deadline) is only at ~17%, and this question requires general public availability — not just an announcement. With only ~3 months remaining and no signs of imminent release, this resolves Yes only in a very unlikely surprise scenario.",
