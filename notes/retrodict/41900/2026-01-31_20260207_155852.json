  "summary": "GPT-6 is very unlikely to be released for general public use before May 1, 2026. Key evidence: (1) No official release date has been announced with only ~3 months remaining; (2) OpenAI has been iterating rapidly on GPT-5.x (5.1, 5.2 released Dec 2025), suggesting the next release will be another point release rather than GPT-6; (3) Manifold Markets prices GPT-6 before June 1, 2026 at only 17%, while pricing a new frontier model >5.2 before March 1 at 80% — strongly suggesting the next model won't carry the \"GPT-6\" name; (4) OpenAI has acknowledged compute constraints limiting deployment; (5) Even optimistic speculation centers on \"mid-2026\" for GPT-6. The question's strict naming requirement means even a major new model release doesn't count unless explicitly named \"GPT-6.\"",
