  "summary": "OpenAI releasing a model named \"GPT-6\" for general public availability before May 1, 2026 is very unlikely. As of February 2026, OpenAI is still actively iterating on the GPT-5.x series (GPT-5.3-Codex was just released on Feb 5, 2026). No official GPT-6 release date has been announced - only vague \"sometime in 2026\" guidance. Multiple credible sources place the likely release window at mid-to-late 2026 or even early 2027 for general availability. The Manifold market for \"GPT-6 before June 1, 2026\" (one month LATER than this question) trades at only ~17%. With only ~3 months until the deadline and no announcement, preview, or concrete timeline, this is extremely unlikely.",
