  "summary": "GPT-6 release before May 1, 2026 is very unlikely. OpenAI officially confirmed GPT-6 would not ship in 2025, and as of late January 2026 they are still iterating on the GPT-5 series (GPT-5.2 released December 2025). Sam Altman said the wait for GPT-6 would be shorter than GPT-4→GPT-5 (~2 years), suggesting earliest mid-2026 at best. Hardware for next-gen models arrives H2 2026. There is no official announcement, leaked date, or credible indication of an imminent GPT-6 launch. The Manifold market for \"GPT-6 before June 1, 2026\" is at ~17%, and our deadline is a month earlier. The question resolves in ~3 months with no sign of an approaching release.",
