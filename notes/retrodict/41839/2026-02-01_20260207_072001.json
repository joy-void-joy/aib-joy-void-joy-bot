  "summary": "New START expires February 5, 2026 \u2014 just 4 days from the question's close date. The treaty's one-time formal extension clause was already exercised in 2021, so no further extension is legally possible under its terms. Russia suspended participation in 2023, and while Putin proposed a voluntary one-year extension of central limits in September 2025 and Trump called it \"a good idea,\" no formal negotiations followed. As of late January 2026, Moscow says it has \"no clear interlocutors\" in the US administration, and multiple expert sources (Chatham House, RFE/RL, Arms Control Association, New Scientist) all confirm no extension or replacement is coming. A replacement treaty would require months or years of negotiation. Resolution is overwhelmingly NO.",
