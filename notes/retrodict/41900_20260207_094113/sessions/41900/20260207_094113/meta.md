# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Question: Will OpenAI release GPT-6 for general public availability before May 1, 2026?
Final forecast: ~4% probability
High confidence in NO outcome.

## Research Audit
- search_exa: Very useful. Found key articles confirming OpenAI denied GPT-6 in 2025, GPT-5 series timeline (5.0→5.1→5.2), and speculative timelines.
- manifold_price: Very useful. Found directly comparable market at 16.6% for "before June 1 2026" and 76.3% for "in 2026".
- web_search: Corroborated findings from exa.
- polymarket: No relevant markets found.

## Reasoning Quality Check

*Strongest evidence FOR my forecast (NO):*
1. OpenAI officially confirmed GPT-6 not shipping in 2025. They're still iterating on GPT-5 series (5.2 released Dec 2025).
2. Hardware for next-gen models arriving H2 2026. Compute constraints explicitly cited by Altman.
3. No announcement, no leaked date, no indication of imminent release.
4. Manifold market for "before June 1" at only 16.6%, and our deadline is a month earlier.

*Strongest argument AGAINST my forecast:*
- OpenAI could surprise-release. Altman said gap would be shorter than GPT-4→5.
- One YouTube video mentioned "February 2026" but this is unverified speculation.

*Calibration check:*
- Question type: Predictive
- "Nothing Ever Happens" strongly applies - product launches almost always take longer than hoped
- 3 months is a very short window
- My ~4% accounts for small chance of surprise but reflects strong evidence against

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents - straightforward research question with clear evidence available from direct searches.

## Tool Effectiveness
- All tools worked correctly
- Manifold was the most informative single signal
- No tool failures

## Process Feedback
- The question was relatively straightforward to research
- Market data provided strong anchoring
- "Nothing Ever Happens" guidance was appropriate here

## Calibration Tracking
- 95% CI: [1%, 10%] for probability
- Would move up significantly if: OpenAI announces GPT-6 preview or release date
- Would move down to ~1% if: OpenAI announces GPT-5.3 or similar incremental update
