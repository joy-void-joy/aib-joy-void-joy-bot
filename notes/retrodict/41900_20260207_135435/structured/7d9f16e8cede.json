  "content": "1. OpenAI's current model lineage as of Feb 2026: GPT-5 (Aug 2025), GPT-5.1 (Nov 2025), GPT-5.2 (Dec 11, 2025), GPT-5.3-Codex (Feb 5, 2026)\n2. OpenAI explicitly confirmed in Oct 2025 that GPT-6 would NOT launch in 2025\n3. No firm release date announced for GPT-6 - \"sometime in 2026\" is all we know officially\n4. Sam Altman said gap between GPT-5 and GPT-6 will be shorter than GPT-4 to GPT-5\n5. Speculation points to \"first half of 2026\" or \"early 2026\" but these are from third-party sources\n6. One source (techannouncer) says \"private previews in mid-2026 and a public release later in 2026 or early 2027\"\n7. OpenAI is still actively iterating on GPT-5.x series (5.1, 5.2, 5.3-Codex)\n8. Manifold market \"Will OpenAI release a model referred to as GPT-6 before June 1st, 2026?\" at 16.6%\n9. Manifold market \"GPT-6 released in 2026?\" at 76.3%\n10. OpenAI acknowledged compute/inference bottlenecks serving users",
