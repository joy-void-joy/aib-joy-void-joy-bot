# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Post ID: 41758 - Will North Korea conduct a nuclear test before May 1, 2026?
Final forecast: ~5% probability (logit: -2.9)
Approach: Base rate calculation from historical nuclear tests, updated with satellite imagery analysis, diplomatic context, and "Nothing Ever Happens" adjustment.

## Research Audit
- search_exa (4 calls): Very useful. Found current NK military developments, Punggye-ri status, diplomatic context, and Party Congress plans.
- get_metaculus_questions: Useful for seeing related resolved questions and background info on base rates.
- polymarket_price / manifold_price: No relevant Polymarket markets. One tangential Manifold market found.
- Most informative sources: Daily NK satellite analysis (Nov 2025), CSIS Beyond Parallel, Chatham House analysis, AP/Al Jazeera on Party Congress.

## Reasoning Quality Check

Strongest evidence FOR my forecast (low probability):
1. 8+ year gap since last test despite technical readiness since 2022 - strong revealed preference for not testing
2. No satellite evidence of imminent test preparations as of Nov 2025
3. Diplomatic window (possible Trump-Kim April 2026 meeting) creates incentive not to test

Strongest argument AGAINST my forecast:
- A smart disagreer would note that NK has been escalating weapons demonstrations, the Party Congress could be a catalyst, and the US action against Maduro has worsened relations. Kim could decide to test with very short notice given preparations are complete.
- Evidence that would change my mind: satellite imagery showing new activity at Tunnel No. 3 (equipment, vehicles, cables), or a sudden breakdown in diplomatic overtures.

Calibration check:
- Question type: Predictive
- "Nothing Ever Happens" applies strongly here - NK has been "about to test" for years
- My ~5% feels right for a 3-month window given the persistent non-testing pattern

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents. The question is straightforward enough that direct research was sufficient. The key factors (technical readiness, satellite evidence, diplomatic context) were all accessible through direct search.

## Tool Effectiveness
- search_exa: Excellent for finding recent NK military/diplomatic developments
- polymarket_price: No results (no relevant market exists)
- manifold_price: One tangential market found
- All tools worked correctly; no failures

## Process Feedback
- The Metaculus question background on base rate (2.7%/month) was very helpful
- Satellite imagery analysis reports from CSIS/38North were the most decision-relevant sources
- The diplomatic context (Trump-Kim potential meeting) added important nuance

## Calibration Tracking
- 80% CI: [2%, 12%]
- Update triggers: satellite evidence of test preparations (+15-20%), diplomatic breakdown (+5%), Party Congress announcing specific nuclear test plans (+10%)
