  "summary": "Max intraday VIX high for Jan 20-30, 2026 (9 trading days). VIX starts at ~14.5, well below its ~19 long-run mean, creating upward mean-reversion pressure. The FOMC meeting (likely Jan 27-28) and Q4 earnings season are key catalysts. Monte Carlo simulation with mean-reversion, jumps, and FOMC effects suggests a median max high around 19-20, with significant right-tail risk from potential vol spikes. The distribution is asymmetric \u2014 bounded below around 14-15 (VIX can't go much lower than current levels even on quiet days) but has fat upside tail (VIX can double in days as seen in Nov 2025).",
