# Meta-Reflection\n\n## Executive Summary\nQuestion: Will the Bank of Japan raise its policy interest rate again before May 1, 2026?\nFinal forecast: ~0.35 (35% probability of Yes)\n\nApproach: Researched current BOJ stance (January 2026 hold at 0.75%), analyst expectations (median July for next hike), market pricing (rates market pricing in some chance of April hike), political dynamics (Takaichi election Feb 8, favors loose policy), and upcoming catalysts (spring wage negotiations, inflation data).\n\n## Research Audit\n- Most useful: Exa searches for analyst views and BOJ meeting outcomes. Found CNBC, Reuters/Asahi, Japan Times, Mainichi articles covering the Jan 23 meeting outcome and forward guidance.\n- Less useful: Could not find exact 2026 BOJ meeting schedule despite multiple attempts. BOJ website fetch failed (web.archive.org redirect issue). No Polymarket or Manifold markets found.\n- Key gap: Did not find swap/OIS market pricing for specific meeting probabilities.\n\n## Reasoning Quality Check\n\n*Strongest evidence FOR (Yes):*\n1. BOJ hawkish signals - Ueda said real rates 'extremely low', Takata dissented wanting immediate hike\n2. 'Some in BOJ see scope to raise rates sooner than markets expect' (Jan 16 headline)\n3. Strong wage growth momentum (5%+ target for third year)\n4. Persistent inflation above 2%\n\n*Strongest argument AGAINST (Yes):*\n- Reuters poll median expects July, not March or April\n- Only ~3 months since December hike\n- Takaichi political pressure for loose policy\n- ING expects October as most likely timing\n- JGB volatility concerns\n\n*Calibration check:*\n- Question type: Predictive\n- 'Nothing Ever Happens' applies moderately - the BOJ is genuinely on a hiking cycle, but the question is about TIMING within a narrow window\n- The key uncertainty is whether 1-2 meetings fall within the window and whether the BOJ acts at those meetings\n- I'm ~65% confident the true probability is between 20% and 45%\n\n## Subagent Decision\nDid not use subagents - the question is relatively straightforward with clear research paths. Multiple search rounds in the main thread were sufficient.\n\n## Tool Effectiveness\n- search_exa: Very effective for finding recent news articles about BOJ policy\n- WebFetch to boj.or.jp: Failed due to web.archive.org redirect (actual tool issue)\n- polymarket_price/manifold_price: No markets found for this topic (empty results, not tool failure)\n- web_search: Limited results but confirmed key articles\n\n## Process Feedback\n- The main challenge was determining the exact BOJ meeting schedule for 2026 to know how many meetings fall in the window\n- Historical patterns (2024 had April 25-26, 2025 had April 30-May 1) suggest the April meeting may or may not fall before May 1\n- This schedule uncertainty is a significant source of forecast uncertainty\n\n## Calibration Tracking\n- 80% CI: [0.20, 0.50]\n- Key update triggers: if BOJ 2026 schedule confirms April meeting ends before May 1 (move up 5-10pp), if yen weakens past 160 (move up 10pp), if Takaichi wins strongly and explicitly pressures BOJ (move down 5pp), if spring wage results disappoint (move down 5-10pp)"
