  "summary": "Key findings on BOJ rate hike probability before May 1 2026",
  "content": "Key findings:\n\n1. BOJ held rates at 0.75% at Jan 22-23 meeting (as expected by all 52 Bloomberg-surveyed economists)\n2. Reuters poll (Jan 15): 97% of 67 economists expect NO change at January AND March meetings\n3. July seen as most likely timing for next hike (not March/April)\n4. BUT: CNBC Jan 16 report says \"BOJ sources see scope to raise rates sooner than markets expect, with April a distinct possibility\" due to sliding yen adding inflationary pressure\n5. Citigroup sees risk of April hike if dollar rises above ¥160 (currently ~152.45)\n6. State Street: base case one hike in 2026, but if yen breaches 160 could see April hike\n7. ING: expects October as most likely timing for next hike\n8. Japan snap election Feb 8 2026 - political uncertainty adds caution\n9. BOJ April 27-28 meeting is a critical date - follows spring wage negotiations and BOJ business survey (April 1)\n10. BOJ March meeting also scheduled before May 1\n\nMeeting schedule in window (Jan 22 - May 1):\n- March meeting (likely mid-March)\n- April 27-28 meeting\n\nKey factors:\n- Consensus: hold through March, possibly hike in April but more likely July\n- Yen at 152.45 - below the 160 threshold that would trigger early hike\n- Spring wage negotiations results will be key data\n- Political uncertainty from snap election\n- BOJ sources hint at April possibility",
