# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Question: Will OpenAI release GPT-6 for general public availability before May 1, 2026?
Final forecast: ~10% probability
Approach: Researched OpenAI's release timeline, Altman's statements, Manifold market prices, and applied Nothing Ever Happens reasoning.

## Research Audit
- Exa searches for GPT-6 release timing: Very useful, found multiple sources with Altman quotes and timeline speculation
- Manifold market prices: Most informative single data point - "GPT-6 before June 1" at 17%, combined with "new model >5.2 before March 1" at 80%, strongly suggesting a new model is coming but won't be named GPT-6
- OpenAI official sources: Found GPT-5.2 announcement (Dec 2025), confirming rapid iteration on GPT-5.x series
- No Polymarket markets found for this specific question

## Reasoning Quality Check

*Strongest evidence FOR my forecast (low probability):*
1. Manifold market at 17% for the more generous "before June 1" deadline
2. No official release date announced with only 3 months to go
3. OpenAI has been iterating on GPT-5.x (5.1, 5.2), suggesting continued point releases rather than a jump to GPT-6
4. Compute bottlenecks acknowledged by Altman

*Strongest argument AGAINST my forecast:*
- Altman teased "big upgrade in Q1 2026" - could this be GPT-6?
- Development reportedly accelerated vs GPT-4→5 gap
- If I'm wrong, it's because OpenAI surprises with a GPT-6 launch in Q1 2026

*Calibration check:*
- Question type: Predictive
- Applied Nothing Ever Happens: Product launches slip, especially with no confirmed date
- The naming requirement is strict - even a revolutionary model doesn't count unless named "GPT-6"

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents. The question is relatively straightforward - it's about a single company's product release timeline. Direct research was sufficient.

## Tool Effectiveness
- search_exa: Good results, found relevant speculation articles
- manifold_price: Excellent, most informative signal
- polymarket_price: No results found (not a failure, just no matching markets)
- web_search: Supplementary confirmation of findings

## Process Feedback
- The Manifold market comparison technique (comparing broader vs narrower questions) was very effective for understanding market expectations
- The key insight was the divergence between "new model coming soon" (80%) and "GPT-6 specifically" (17%)

## Calibration Tracking
- 80% CI: [4%, 20%]
- Update triggers: Official OpenAI announcement of GPT-6, leak of GPT-6 API endpoints, Altman explicitly naming Q1 target as GPT-6
