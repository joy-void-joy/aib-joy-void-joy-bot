  "summary": "GPT-5 released Aug 2025, GPT-5.2 Dec 2025. GPT-6 expected in 2026 but no firm date. Manifold gives 17% for GPT-6 before June 1, 76% for GPT-6 in 2026.",
  "content": "Key findings:\n- GPT-5 released ~Aug 2025, GPT-5.1 followed, GPT-5.2 introduced Dec 11, 2025\n- OpenAI confirmed GPT-6 will NOT launch in 2025, sometime in 2026\n- Sam Altman hinted at faster dev cycle than GPT-4→GPT-5 (2+ years), teased \"big upgrade in Q1 2026\"\n- No official release date for GPT-6\n- Multiple sources speculate \"first half of 2026\" or \"early 2026\"\n- OpenAI acknowledges compute/inference bottlenecks limiting deployment\n- Manifold: \"GPT-6 before June 1, 2026\" = 16.6% (7.2k mana volume)\n- Manifold: \"GPT-6 released in 2026\" = 76.3% (6.2k mana volume)\n- Manifold: \"frontier model >5.2 before March 1, 2026\" = 80.1%\n- This gap (80% for new model soon, but only 17% for GPT-6 name) suggests next release likely NOT named GPT-6\n- Question requires explicit \"GPT-6\" naming and general public availability before May 1, 2026",
