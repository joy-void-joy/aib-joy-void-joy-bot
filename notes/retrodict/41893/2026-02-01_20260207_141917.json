  "summary": "The 2026 Nepal House of Representatives election (March 5) is a genuinely competitive multi-party race. Nepali Congress is the most likely winner of the most seats, benefiting from: (1) being the largest party in 2022 with 89 seats and strong organizational depth across all 165 constituencies, (2) the FPTP system favoring established parties with deep local networks, (3) the left-wing vote being split three ways (CPN-UML, NCP, RSP), and (4) new younger leadership under Gagan Thapa. CPN-UML is the second most likely despite strong anti-incumbency from Oli's forced resignation during Gen Z protests. RSP, boosted by Balen Shah's merger and Gen Z momentum, is a serious contender but faces a massive gap from 20 seats (2022) to becoming the largest party, with limited rural reach. The new Nepali Communist Party (Maoist Centre merger) is an untested entity. No formal polling data or prediction markets are available.",
