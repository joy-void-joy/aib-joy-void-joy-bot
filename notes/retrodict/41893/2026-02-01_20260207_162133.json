  "summary": "The 2026 Nepal House of Representatives election (March 5) features a fragmented race among NC, CPN-UML, RSP, and the newly-formed NCP. Nepali Congress is the front-runner for winning the most seats due to three key structural advantages: (1) the left vote is split between CPN-UML and NCP, giving NC an enormous advantage in FPTP constituencies (165 of 275 seats); (2) NC has new energized leadership under Gagan Thapa and just won the most seats in the January 2026 National Assembly election; (3) anti-incumbency sentiment targets CPN-UML (Oli was PM during Gen Z protests). However, RSP with the hugely popular Balen Shah as PM candidate and post-Gen Z momentum (60% of surveyed voters want new parties) has a credible shot at a major surge. CPN-UML retains strong organizational depth but faces headwinds. The NCP merger consolidates leftist forces but is untested.",
