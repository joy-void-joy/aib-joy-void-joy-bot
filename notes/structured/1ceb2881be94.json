  "content": "Key finding from Security Council Report February 2026 Monthly Forecast article titled \"In Hindsight: The Security Council's Muted Response to the Venezuela Crisis\":\n\nThe search result summary states: \"About a month has passed since the US operation, which many describe as a seismic event, yet there have been no proposals for a Council product or a meeting to follow up on developments in the country. There have also been no initiatives to discuss the matter at the General Assembly.\"\n\nThis is a highly credible source that specifically tracks UN proceedings. Written for the February 2026 forecast (likely late January), it directly addresses the UNGA question.\n\nAlso notable: Some search engine AI summaries appear to conflate the 1989 Panama UNGA resolution vote (75-20-40) with the 2026 Venezuela situation. The 75-20-40 vote was for Resolution 44/240 on Panama, not any 2026 Venezuela resolution.\n\nHistorical precedents:\n- Panama 1989: UNGA resolution adopted 9 days after invasion\n- Grenada 1983: UNGA resolution adopted 8 days after invasion\n- Venezuela 2026: No UNGA resolution even proposed as of ~late January",
