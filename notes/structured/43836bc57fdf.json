  "content": "Key findings:\n1. The specific lawsuit (People of California v Meta Platforms, 4:23-cv-05448) was filed Oct 2023 by 34+ state AGs.\n2. As of late 2025/early 2026, discovery disputes are ongoing (document production, deposition scope).\n3. The Ninth Circuit ruled on Aug 22, 2025 on a mandamus petition about document production - litigation is still in pretrial phase.\n4. September 2025: Stipulation about pre-motion letter briefs filed - suggesting summary judgment motions coming.\n5. Federal bellwether trials in the MDL are not expected until summer/late 2026.\n6. States recently sought to combine their claims into a single trial (Dec 30, 2025 news).\n7. No reports of settlement talks between Meta and the AG coalition.\n8. Meta is actively fighting on all fronts - fighting summary judgment, discovery disputes.\n9. Separate from the AG case: bellwether individual trials have begun in CA state court (KGM case, Jan 27, 2026). TikTok and Snap settled their portions, but Meta proceeded to trial.\n10. New Mexico AG trial against Meta began Feb 2, 2026.\n11. The sokolovelaw source from Feb 2026 explicitly states: \"no Facebook or Meta lawsuit mental health settlements have been announced yet.\"\n12.
