  "summary": "RPONTSYD series tracks temporary open market repo operations, which effectively ended in July 2021 when replaced by Standing Repo Facility. Recent values are 0.000-0.002 billion. Series has been essentially dormant for years.",
  "content": "## Key Findings\n\n### Current Status\n- Last data point (Jan 30, 2026): 0.000 billion\n- Recent values: Jan 28 (0.002), Jan 27 (0.001), Jan 26 (0.001)\n- Pattern: Consistently near zero\n\n### Historical Context\n- Sept 2019: Crisis caused $75B+ daily injections via temp repo\n- March 2020: COVID crisis saw hundreds of billions\n- June 2020: Market participants stopped using Fed liquidity facility\n- Jan 2021: NY Fed discontinued regular repo facility\n- July 2021: Standing Repo Facility (SRF) established as permanent backstop\n- Since mid-2020: RPONTSYD essentially dormant\n\n### Current Market Environment (Feb 2026)\n- Fed ended QT as of Dec 2025\n- Reserve management purchases implemented ($40B in T-bills)\n- Fed funds rate: 3.50%-3.75%\n- Year-end stress has eased\n- No indication of imminent market stress\n\n### Key Distinction\nRPONTSYD tracks \"Temporary Open Market Operations\" - these are different from SRF operations. The SRF is the modern backstop and has its own tracking. The temporary ops series is essentially legacy.\n\n### Forecast Implications\n- Strong base case: 0.000-0.005 billion\n- Small tail risk: Unexpected market stress could require intervention\n- February 10, 2026 is a normal Tuesday, no known stress catalysts",
