  "topic": "UNGA Venezuela resolution forecast synthesis",
  "summary": "Strong historical precedent and broad condemnation suggest high probability (~85%) of UNGA resolution before Feb 1",
  "content": "Key factors:\n\nFOR (YES):\n1. Historical precedent: 100% success rate (2/2) - Panama 1989 took 9 days, Grenada 1983 took 8 days\n2. Timeline sufficient: 21 days remaining vs 8-9 days historically needed\n3. Strong international condemnation including US allies (France, UK)\n4. UN Secretary General explicitly said US violated UN Charter\n5. UN experts condemned action on Jan 7, 2026\n6. Similar circumstances: capture of head of state, military incursion\n\nAGAINST (NO):\n1. Some NATO countries support the intervention\n2. No confirmed UNGA resolution scheduled yet (as of Jan 11)\n3. Different context: Maduro more widely seen as illegitimate\n4. Political dynamics different than Cold War era\n\nAssessment: Historical precedent is very strong, timeline is adequate, condemnation is broad. The UNGA has always passed resolutions condemning US unilateral military interventions within ~1 week when there's broad condemnation. With 21 days left and even allies criticizing, this seems highly likely to happen.",
