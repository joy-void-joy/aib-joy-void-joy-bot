  "topic": "UNGA resolution on Venezuela - status and analysis",
  "summary": "Analysis of whether UNGA will adopt a resolution condemning US operation in Venezuela before Feb 1, 2026",
  "content": "# Key Findings\n\n## Timeline\n- Jan 3: US military operation captures Maduro\n- Jan 5: UNSC emergency meeting - broad condemnation\n- Jan 7: UN experts urge member states to condemn\n- Jan 9: Venezuela's envoy expressed regret to Guterres that UN had NOT yet condemned the action\n- As of Jan 11: No evidence of UNGA resolution adopted or emergency special session called\n\n## Historical Precedents\n- Grenada (1983): Invasion Oct 25 → UNGA Resolution 38/7 Nov 2 (8 days)\n- Panama (1989): Invasion Dec 20 → UNSC veto Dec 23 → UNGA Resolution 44/240 Dec 29 (9 days total)\n- Iraq (2003): No UNGA condemnation resolution despite massive opposition\n- Ukraine (2022): UNSC referral Feb 27 → UNGA resolution Mar 2 (3 days)\n\n## Process Paths\n1. UNSC draft → US veto → \"Uniting for Peace\" ESS → UNGA resolution\n2. Regular UNGA session resolution\n\n## Factors FOR resolution\n- Strong historical precedent (Grenada, Panama)\n- Overwhelming international condemnation including from allies\n- Even France/UK critical (unlike Panama where they vetoed WITH US)\n- NAM (120+ members) already condemned through Uganda\n- Russia/China motivated to embarrass US\n- UNGA President Baerbock critical\n- UN Secretary-General critical\n- 3 weeks remaining\n\n## Factors AGAINST resolution\n- No evidence of draft resolution as of Jan 9\n- No UNSC veto yet (process hasn't started)\n- Iraq 2003 precedent - no UNGA condemnation despite opposition\n- US under Trump may pressure allies\n- Venezuela lost voting rights (Article 19, arrears)\n- Process slower than expected vs historical precedents",
