  "content": "# UF Google Trends Analysis\n\n## What \"uf\" refers to\n- Primarily University of Florida (most common interpretation)\n- The Florida Gators are the defending 2025 NCAA Men's Basketball national champions\n- Currently ranked #19, with 13-5 record (4-1 SEC), atop SEC standings\n\n## Key Events in Feb 2-10 Window\n- Feb 2 (Monday): No major UF events - just a regular weekday\n- Feb 7 (Saturday, 7:30 PM): UF basketball at Texas A&M\n- Feb 10 (Tuesday): UF basketball at Georgia\n\n## Current State\n- Current interest value: 49 (as of Feb 1, 2026)\n- Resolution threshold: ±3 points\n\n## Factors to Consider\n1. Basketball game on Feb 10 could spike searches (game day effect)\n2. As defending champions, interest in Gators remains elevated\n3. No major games on Feb 2 for comparison baseline\n4. Google Trends has inherent sampling variability\n5. Weekday vs weekday comparison (Mon vs Tue) - similar patterns expected\n6. Campus utility disruption mentioned in news could drive some searches\n\n## Base Rate Considerations\n- For a ±3 threshold on value of ~49 (6% variation allowed)\n- Regular university search terms are relatively stable\n- Sports events can cause temporary spikes but typically modest",
