# Feedback Loop Analysis: 2026-02-07 (Session 3)

## Ground Truth Status

- Resolved questions in AIB tournament: 12
- Questions with live forecasts matched to resolutions: 0 (all resolved before we started)
- Retrodictions completed: 7 unique questions (8 total runs)
- Binary retrodiction Brier scores: 0.0001 (41839), 0.7225 (41521)
- Numeric retrodictions: All 3 within confidence intervals
- **New missed questions available for retrodiction: 24**
- Live forecasts with CP comparison: 34

## Object-Level Findings

### Bug Fixes Implemented

| Bug | Impact | Root Cause | Fix |
|-----|--------|-----------|-----|
| Async semaphore event loop mismatch | 30% error rate on search_exa | Module-level `asyncio.Semaphore` binds to first event loop; fails when `asyncio.run()` creates new loops | Lazy per-loop semaphore creation via `_get_semaphore()` |
| get_metaculus_questions 50% error | Agent passes question_id instead of post_id | No auto-detection; opaque error message | Added `_resolve_question_to_post_id()` fallback + helpful error messages |
| get_cp_history empty results | 100% "failure" in retrodict mode | All CP data points filtered when cutoff = publication date | Added explicit note explaining why no data available |

### Tool Discoverability Improvements

Improved descriptions for 7 underused tools with explicit "USE THIS when..." triggers:
- `search_arxiv`: "USE THIS for questions about AI benchmarks, scientific discoveries..."
- `get_coherence_links`: "USE THIS to check if your forecast is consistent with related questions"
- `get_cp_history`: "ESSENTIAL for meta-prediction questions"
- `fred_search`: "USE THIS when you don't know the series ID for an economic indicator"
- `company_financials`: "USE THIS FIRST for any earnings/revenue forecast question"
- `polymarket_history`/`manifold_history`: "USE THIS to see how prediction market sentiment evolved"
- `spawn_subquestions`: "USE THIS for questions that depend on multiple independent factors"

### Reasoning Quality (from trace reading)

- **Excellent**: 7 forecasts (New START, Alphabet EMEA, Google Trends sessions, Zepbound actual data)
- **Good**: 8 forecasts (Greenland meta, Powell meta, VIX, Gorton by-election)
- **Decent**: 2 forecasts (Grammy — slightly underconfident on clear signals)
- **Weak**: 0

### Validated Edge

41835 (US government shutdown): 97% vs CP 25%, resolved YES. Genuine outperformance.

## CP Divergence Analysis

34 forecasts with CP data:
- Average divergence: +7.1% (slightly bullish)
- Bias check: 14 higher than CP, 13 lower (balanced)
- **Meta-predictions cluster**: 5 of 6 largest divergences (25-33pp above CP)
- Cannot evaluate meta-prediction calibration without resolution data

## Meta-Level Findings

### Tracking Gaps Identified

1. **No meta-reflection in retrodict mode** — session notes lack structured meta-reflections
2. **No cost aggregation** — token usage tracked but not aggregated per-forecast
3. **question_category field added (prior session)** — but no analysis of category-level calibration yet

### Analysis Process Quality

This session was productive:
- Found and fixed the semaphore bug (highest-impact fix)
- Added auto-detection for get_metaculus_questions
- Improved 7 tool descriptions for discoverability
- Identified 24 new retrodiction opportunities

## Meta-Meta Findings

### Infrastructure Improvements

No new scripts needed this session. The existing feedback_collect.py, forecast_queue.py, and trace_forecast.py covered the analysis workflow well.

### feedback-loop.md Assessment

The document worked well as a guide. No updates needed.

## Changes Made

| Level | Change | File(s) | Rationale |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Object | Lazy semaphore creation | forecasting.py, wayback.py, cache.py | Fix 30% search error rate |
| Object | Auto-detect question_id in get_metaculus_questions | forecasting.py | Fix 50% error rate |
| Object | CP history empty result messaging | forecasting.py | Explain retrodict filtering |
| Object | Improved 7 tool descriptions | arxiv_search.py, financial.py, markets.py, composition.py, forecasting.py | Tool discoverability |
| Meta | N/A | N/A | Tracking gaps noted but not addressed this session |
| Meta-Meta | Analysis report | This file | Document findings |

## Retrodiction Recommendations

5-8 diverse questions to retrodict next, selected for domain diversity and type coverage:

**Binary (3):**
1. **41758** — Will North Korea conduct a nuclear test before May 1, 2026? (geopolitics)
2. **41900** — Will OpenAI release GPT-6 for general public? (AI/tech)
3. **41755** — Will Bank of Japan raise policy rate again? (monetary policy)

**Numeric (3):**
4. **41875** — Trump approval rating on Feb 14 (politics, short-horizon)
5. **41871** — NVIDIA forward guidance Q4 FY2026 earnings (finance)
6. **41753** — Netflix revenue YoY growth Q1 2026 (finance)

**Multiple Choice (2):**
7. **41893** — Which party wins most seats in 2026 Nepali House election? (international politics)
8. **41751** — In which region will Netflix have higher Q1 2026 revenues? (finance)

These span geopolitics, tech, finance, and monetary policy across binary/numeric/MC types.
