# Meta-Reflection\n\n## Executive Summary\nPost ID: 41205. Question: Will OpenAI file an S-1 with SEC before March 15, 2026?\nFinal forecast: ~3% probability (very unlikely)\nApproach: Checked current filing status, gathered timeline reporting, cross-referenced prediction markets.\n\n## Research Audit\n- Metaculus question details: Useful - got CP at 10% and resolution criteria\n- Exa search: Failed due to async error (actual tool failure)\n- WebSearch: Very useful - confirmed no S-1 filed, H2 2026 earliest timeline\n- Manifold: Very useful - 1.4% for IPO by March 2026\n- Polymarket: No relevant market found\n\n## Reasoning Quality Check\n\n*Strongest evidence FOR my forecast (NO):*\n1. No S-1 filed, company still in informal bank discussions\n2. CFO explicitly targeting 2027 listing, H2 2026 earliest filing\n3. Manifold at 1.4% for even broader IPO question by March\n\n*Strongest argument AGAINST my forecast:*\n- Could there be a surprise early filing? Extremely unlikely given the company's own stated timeline and the fact that major prerequisite steps (fundraising round, bank selection) haven't been completed.\n\n*Calibration check:*\n- Question type: Predictive\n- Nothing Ever Happens strongly applies - filing an S-1 in 36 days when company targets H2 2026 at earliest is near-impossible\n- Metaculus CP at 10% seems slightly high given the evidence\n\n## Subagent Decision\nDid not use subagents - this is a straightforward question with clear evidence pointing strongly in one direction.\n\n## Tool Effectiveness\n- WebSearch: Effective, provided key news articles\n- Manifold: Effective, provided strong market signal\n- Exa: Actual failure (async lock error) - tool bug\n- CP History: 404 error - tool issue\n\n## Calibration Tracking\n- 97% confident this resolves NO\n- Update trigger: News of surprise S-1 filing (would move to 99% YES immediately)
