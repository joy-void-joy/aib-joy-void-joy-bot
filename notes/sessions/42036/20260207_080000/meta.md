# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Question about the upper bound of the Federal Funds Target Range on February 28, 2026. Currently 3.75%. Next FOMC meeting is March 17-18, after the resolution date. This is essentially a near-certainty question: 3.75% unless there's an emergency intermeeting rate change, which is extremely rare and there are no indications of one.

## Research Audit
- FRED data confirmed current rate of 3.75% (last updated Feb 6, 2026)
- Exa search found the official FOMC statement from Jan 28, 2026 confirming the hold
- FOMC schedule confirms next meeting is March 17-18, well after Feb 28

## Reasoning Quality Check
Strongest evidence FOR 3.75%:
1. FRED data shows 3.75% as current upper bound
2. No FOMC meeting between now and Feb 28

Strongest argument AGAINST:
- An emergency intermeeting rate change. These are extremely rare (last ones were during COVID in March 2020). No financial crisis or emergency conditions currently evident.

Calibration: This is a measurement question where the current value is known and the mechanism for change (FOMC meeting) is not scheduled before the resolution date. Confidence is extremely high (~99%).

## Subagent Decision
No subagents used - straightforward question with clear answer from FRED data and FOMC schedule.

## Tool Effectiveness
- FRED series tool: Excellent, provided exact current value
- Exa search: Excellent, found official Fed statement and FOMC schedule

## Process Feedback
Simple question that didn't need complex research. The key insight is that the next FOMC meeting is after the resolution date.

## Calibration Tracking
99% CI: [3.50, 3.75] (covering the possibility of an emergency 25bp cut)
99.5%+ confidence that the answer is exactly 3.75%
