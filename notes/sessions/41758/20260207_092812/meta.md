# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Post ID: 41758. Title: Will North Korea conduct a nuclear test before May 1, 2026?
Final forecast: ~5% probability. This is a classic "Nothing Ever Happens" question where NK has been technically ready for years but consistently chooses not to test.

## Research Audit
- Metaculus search found several prior NK nuclear test questions, all apparently resolved No
- Exa search yielded excellent results: recent Jan 2026 news on Kim's nuclear plans, Nov 2025 satellite imagery analysis from Daily NK, and SK intelligence assessments
- No Polymarket markets found; Manifold only had a conditional question
- Could not access community predictions (AIB tournament)

Most informative sources: Daily NK Nov 2025 satellite analysis (no preparations visible), SK DIA Nov 2025 assessment (technically ready but no political decision), 38 North Jan 2026 quarterly briefing

## Reasoning Quality Check

Strongest evidence FOR my forecast (No):
1. NK has been technically ready since 2022 - over 3 years without testing despite capability
2. No visible preparations at Punggye-ri (no instruments, cables, vehicles) as of Nov 2025
3. Multiple prior Metaculus questions on this topic have resolved No
4. Only 3-month window
5. Trump engagement opportunity may incentivize restraint

Strongest argument AGAINST my forecast:
- Kim is escalating rhetoric, ordering more missiles, and planning party congress announcements about nuclear deterrent
- Intelligence says test could happen on "short notice" with only political decision needed
- A smart disagreer would say: the party congress could be the trigger event, and Kim may want to demonstrate capability before engaging Trump

Calibration check:
- Question type: Predictive
- "Nothing Ever Happens" strongly applies - this has been predicted for years
- 5% feels right: not impossible, but very unlikely in 3 months given no visible preparations

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents - this question is well-served by direct research. The key factors (technical readiness, satellite imagery, geopolitics) are straightforward to assess with web searches.

## Tool Effectiveness
- search_exa: Very useful, found recent news and expert analysis
- search_metaculus: Useful for finding prior questions
- get_metaculus_questions: Useful for getting resolution details
- manifold_price: Limited results, only a conditional question
- polymarket_price: No results found (not a failure, just no market exists)

## Process Feedback
- The prompt guidance on "Nothing Ever Happens" was highly relevant here
- Base rate calculation was informative but the moratorium period makes the simple rate misleading

## Calibration Tracking
- 80% CI: [2%, 12%]
- I'm 90% confident the true probability is below 15%
- Update triggers: Satellite imagery showing preparations at Punggye-ri (+15-20%), Kim announcing test plans at party congress (+10%), Trump-Kim talks announced (-3%)
