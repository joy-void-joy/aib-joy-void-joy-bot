# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Post ID 41371: "How many dissenting votes will there be at the January 28, 2026 FOMC meeting?"
Final forecast: ~97% on "2" dissents, with small residuals on other options.
The meeting has already occurred (Jan 28, 2026) and today is Feb 6, 2026. Multiple credible news sources (CNBC, Federal Reserve official statement, J.P. Morgan, Yahoo Finance) confirm the FOMC voted to hold rates at 3.50-3.75%, with exactly 2 dissenting votes from Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller.

## Research Audit
- Initial research: Searched for FOMC composition changes, recent dissent history, and expectations - useful context
- Key breakthrough: Realized today's date (Feb 6) means the meeting already happened, then searched for actual results
- Most informative source: WebSearch returning CNBC and Federal Reserve official statement confirming 2 dissents
- The Exa search tool returned empty results for some January 2026 queries, but the WebSearch tool filled the gap

## Reasoning Quality Check
*Strongest evidence FOR my forecast:*
1. Multiple major financial news outlets (CNBC, Yahoo Finance, Fox Business) report 2 dissents
2. Federal Reserve's own official statement is referenced

*Strongest argument AGAINST:*
- Extremely slim chance the sources are wrong or I'm misreading them. The consistency across multiple sources makes this negligible.

*Calibration check:*
- This is effectively a definitional/resolved question since the event has occurred
- Very high confidence is appropriate

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents - the question resolved to a factual lookup once I realized the meeting had already occurred.

## Tool Effectiveness
- WebSearch: Extremely effective, found the answer immediately with multiple confirming sources
- Exa search: Returned empty results for some queries about the Jan 2026 meeting results, but was useful for pre-meeting context
- WebFetch: Failed with 404 on kitco.com and redirect issues with federalreserve.gov

## Process Feedback
- Key insight: Always check current date against question resolution date early in the process
- Could have saved several searches by checking the actual results immediately

## Calibration Tracking
- 98% CI that answer is "2 dissents" based on confirmed news reports
- Would only revise if official Fed statement contradicts news reports
