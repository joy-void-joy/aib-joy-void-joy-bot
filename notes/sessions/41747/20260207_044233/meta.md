# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
- Post ID: 41976 (Zepbound Q4 2025 Global Revenue)
- Final forecast: Median ~$5,000M with 80% CI of $4,300M - $5,700M
- Confidence level: Moderate - based on strong historical data but uncertainty about Q4 2025 sequential growth pattern

## Research Audit
### Searches Performed
1. Metaculus question fetch - returned wrong question (ID mismatch), but search results were useful
2. Zepbound Q4 2025 earnings searches - found Q4 2024 data ($1.9B) and 2025 quarterly data
3. Historical quarterly revenue search - found complete Statista data for Q1 2024 - Q3 2025
4. Analyst estimates search - found early 2025 estimates ($10.39B FY2025) but no Q4 2025 specific estimates
5. Earnings date search - no results on Q4 2025 release date
6. Manifold Markets - no relevant markets found

### Most Informative Sources
- Statista table with complete quarterly revenue history (Q1 2024 - Q3 2025)
- Eli Lilly investor relations press releases for Q1-Q3 2025
- FiercePharma and BioPharma Dive reporting on quarterly results

## Reasoning Quality Check

### Strongest Evidence FOR My Forecast (~$5,000M median)
1. Clear historical growth trajectory: Q3 2025 was $3,588M, and YoY growth has been 170-185%
2. Q4 typically shows strong seasonality (Q4 2024 was +51.6% vs Q3 2024)
3. Lilly has consistently raised guidance throughout 2025, indicating strong demand
4. No evidence of supply constraints or major competitive disruption

### Strongest Argument AGAINST My Forecast
- Q3 2025 showed only 6.1% sequential growth (vs 46% in Q2), suggesting potential market maturation
- CVS dropped Zepbound from preferred formulary in mid-2025, could impact Q4 volumes
- If Q3 moderation continues, Q4 could be closer to $3,800-4,200M

### Calibration Check
- Question type: Numeric measurement (definitional once earnings released)
- Applied moderate skepticism given the uncertainty about Q4 sequential pattern
- The wide distribution (80% CI spanning $1,400M) reflects genuine uncertainty
- Since Q4 2025 earnings will be released imminently (late Jan/early Feb 2026), actual result will resolve this

## Subagent Decision
- Did not use subagents - this is a straightforward data gathering task
- Direct searches were efficient for finding quarterly revenue data
- No need for Fermi estimation since actual historical data is available

## Tool Effectiveness
- **Worked well**: search_exa found relevant earnings reports and Statista data
- **No results**: Some specific Q4 2025 analyst estimate searches returned empty
- **Note**: Manifold Markets had no relevant prediction markets
- **execute_code**: Very useful for calculating growth rates and building distribution

## Process Feedback
- The systematic approach of gathering quarterly data, then projecting, worked well
- Key insight: Q3 2025 showed significant growth moderation (6.1% sequential vs 46% in Q2)
- This moderation creates genuine uncertainty about Q4 pattern

## Calibration Tracking
- 80% CI: $4,300M - $5,700M
- I'm ~70% confident the actual value falls in $4,500M - $5,500M range
- Update triggers: If sequential growth from Q3 is <15% → revise down; if >50% → revise up
