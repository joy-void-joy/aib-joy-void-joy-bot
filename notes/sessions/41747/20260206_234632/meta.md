# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Question about Zepbound Q4 2025 global revenue. Earnings report on Feb 4, 2026. My central estimate is ~$4,250M with 80% CI of roughly $3,500-$5,300M.

## Research Audit
- Exa search for Zepbound quarterly data: Very useful - found complete Q1 2024 through Q3 2025 data from Statista
- Exa search for analyst estimates: Partially useful - found early 2025 consensus of $10.39B FY2025, now clearly outdated
- Exa search for earnings date: Confirmed Feb 4, 2026
- Web search for Q4 2025 specific previews: Limited results, likely because earnings are just days away and previews may be paywalled
- Code execution for scenario analysis: Very useful for systematic estimation

Most informative source: Statista quarterly revenue table + Lilly Q3 2025 press release

## Reasoning Quality Check

*Strongest evidence FOR ~$4,200-4,400M:*
1. Multiple estimation approaches converge (QoQ, YoY, seasonal, guidance-implied)
2. Clear seasonal Q3→Q4 uplift pattern
3. Full-year guidance constraints narrow the range

*Strongest argument AGAINST:*
- No direct analyst consensus for Q4 Zepbound specifically found
- Price cuts in Dec 2025 could drag revenue below trend
- International component is small but growing, adding uncertainty
- A smart disagreer might say the seasonal uplift in 2024 was inflated by early ramp-up dynamics that won't repeat

*Calibration check:*
- Question type: Measurement (specific financial report)
- Uncertainty is moderate - the quarter is over, the number exists, we just don't know it
- My 80% CI seems appropriate - not too wide, not too narrow for a product with strong growth trends

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents. The question is a single quantitative estimation that benefits from sequential research (each finding informs the next search). Subagents would add overhead without benefit.

## Tool Effectiveness
- search_exa: Effective for finding financial data and press releases
- web_search: Less effective - mostly returned older results
- execute_code: Very useful for systematic calculations
- No tool failures encountered; some searches returned empty results (expected for very recent topics)

## Process Feedback
- The quarterly revenue data from Statista was the single most valuable data point
- Would have been helpful to have access to real-time analyst consensus data (FactSet, Bloomberg)
- The approach of using multiple estimation methods provided good triangulation

## Calibration Tracking
- 80% CI: [$3,500M, $5,300M]
- Confidence in central estimate: ~65%
- Update triggers: Any pre-announcement from Lilly, real-time prescription data
