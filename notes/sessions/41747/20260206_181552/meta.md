# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
- Post ID: 36653
- Question: Zepbound Q4 2025 global revenue
- Final forecast: Extremely narrow distribution centered on $4,261 million
- Confidence: >99%

This was a straightforward question where the resolution source (Eli Lilly Q4 2025 earnings) was already available. The official earnings release from February 4, 2026 clearly states Zepbound Q4 2025 revenue of $4,261 million.

2. PRNewswire press release covering the same data
3. BioPharma Dive analysis articles

## Reasoning Quality Check

*Strongest evidence FOR my forecast:*
1. Official Eli Lilly earnings table explicitly shows "Zepbound(1) 4,261" for Q4 2025
2. Math verification: Q1+Q2+Q3+Q4 = 2,312+3,381+3,588+4,261 = 13,542M (matches reported FY2025 total)
3. Multiple corroborating sources from different news outlets

*Strongest argument AGAINST my forecast:*
- Could I be misinterpreting "Global" vs "U.S."? The footnote says Zepbound is marketed in Canada, Japan, and U.S., and the text says U.S. revenue was $4.2B. The $4,261M appears to be total across all markets.
- Minor risk: Is there international Zepbound revenue separately reported? The earnings structure seems to include all geographies in the main table.

*Calibration check:*
- Question type: Measurement (what will the value be?)
- This is essentially a definitional question since the resolution source is now available
- My uncertainty reflects only the possibility of misreading the source

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents. The question was answerable directly from the earnings report - no need for complex research or estimation. This was the right call; spawning agents would have added unnecessary overhead.

## Tool Effectiveness
- search_exa: Excellent - found the exact resolution source on first try
- get_metaculus_questions: 404 error for post 36653 (tool failure - question not found)
- notes(write): Worked correctly for recording findings

## Process Feedback
- The prompt guidance about checking resolution sources first was appropriate here
- Livecrawl feature on search_exa was valuable for getting recent data
- No additional guidance needed for this type of straightforward measurement question

## Calibration Tracking
- Numeric confidence: 99%+ that outcome is $4,261 million (within ±5M)
- Update triggers: A revision or correction to the earnings report would move me, but fine print excludes restatements
