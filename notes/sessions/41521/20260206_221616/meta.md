# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Post ID: 41499 (synced copy). Question: Will UNGA adopt resolution condemning US Venezuela operation before Feb 1, 2026?
Final forecast: ~60% probability (Yes)
Approach: Historical precedent analysis + current event tracking + process pathway analysis

## Research Audit
- search_exa: Multiple searches yielded strong results on UNSC meeting, international reactions, UN process
- web_search: Good coverage of the UNSC meeting and initial reactions
- Most informative sources: Security Council Report (securitycouncilreport.org) - provided excellent historical parallels; PassBlue (Jan 9 article) - key detail about Venezuela's Article 19 status and lack of condemnation as of Jan 9
- WebFetch failed on Wikipedia article (redirect to web.archive.org)
- Could not find evidence of UNGA resolution adopted or ESS called as of Jan 11

## Reasoning Quality Check

*Strongest evidence FOR my forecast (Yes):*
1. 2/2 directly comparable historical precedents (Grenada 1983, Panama 1989) resulted in UNGA condemnation within 8-9 days
2. Condemnation is even more widespread than in those cases (France/UK now critical of US rather than vetoing with US)
3. 3 weeks remaining provides ample time even if process is slower

*Strongest argument AGAINST my forecast:*
- Iraq 2003 is a counter-precedent: massive global opposition but no UNGA condemnation
- As of Jan 9, process appears stalled (no draft resolution circulated)
- A smart disagreer would say: "The Trump administration's willingness to use economic pressure (tariffs, aid) makes countries more cautious about formal condemnation than in 1983/1989"

*Calibration check:*
- Question type: Predictive
- Applied moderate "Nothing Ever Happens" skepticism - the process is slower than expected
- My 60% reflects genuine uncertainty about whether diplomatic momentum translates to a formal resolution

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents - the question is straightforward enough for main-thread research. The key evidence is from news sources and historical precedents, not requiring parallel deep dives.

## Tool Effectiveness
- search_exa and web_search both provided excellent results
- WebFetch had an issue with Wikipedia (redirect to web.archive.org) - actual tool limitation
- No results found for UNGA resolution actually being adopted - this is expected (not a tool failure)
- Notes tool worked correctly for saving findings

## Process Feedback
- The historical precedent comparison was the most valuable analytical framework
- Wish I could have accessed the full Wikipedia article on international reactions
- The question opened very late (Jan 11, same day close), making this effectively a snapshot forecast

## Calibration Tracking
- 80% CI: [40%, 80%]
- Point estimate: 60%
- Update triggers: +20% if UNSC draft resolution is vetoed; +15% if ESS is called; -15% if major allies signal they won't support UNGA resolution
