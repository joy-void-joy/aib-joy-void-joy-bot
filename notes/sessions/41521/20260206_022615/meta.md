# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Post ID: 41499. Question: Will the UN General Assembly adopt a resolution condemning the US operation in Venezuela before February 1, 2026? My final forecast: ~3% (very unlikely). The key evidence is a Security Council Report published Feb 1, 2026, which explicitly states "there have also been no initiatives to discuss the matter at the General Assembly" - essentially confirming the resolution was NOT adopted.

## Research Audit
- Exa searches for UNGA resolution efforts, "Uniting for Peace" mechanism, and Venezuela condemnation were highly productive
- The Security Council Report's February 2026 Monthly Forecast was the single most informative source, essentially providing post-hoc confirmation
- get_metaculus_questions showed community prediction at 3%, aligning with my assessment
- No prediction history existed for this question

## Reasoning Quality Check

*Strongest evidence FOR my forecast (No):*
1. Security Council Report (Feb 1, 2026) explicitly states no UNGA initiatives were pursued
2. No "Uniting for Peace" referral was initiated at the Security Council
3. Community prediction at 3%

*Strongest argument AGAINST my forecast:*
- Historical precedent: UNGA condemned US invasion of Panama (1989) and Grenada (1983), showing such resolutions ARE possible
- Widespread international condemnation, even from US allies
- But the Security Council Report confirms this didn't translate into UNGA action within the timeframe

*Calibration check:*
- Question type: Predictive, but with near-dispositive post-hoc evidence available
- The Feb 1 Security Council Report is from after the deadline, essentially telling us the answer
- My uncertainty is mainly about: (a) whether the SCR report is accurate, (b) whether a resolution could have been adopted very late in January without being mentioned

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents - the question was answerable with direct searches. The post-hoc evidence from the Security Council Report made deep research unnecessary.

## Tool Effectiveness
- search_exa: Excellent - found the key Security Council Report source
- get_metaculus_questions: Useful for community prediction baseline
- get_prediction_history: No prior forecasts found (expected)

## Process Feedback
- The availability of post-hoc evidence (Feb 1 publication date vs Feb 1 deadline) made this straightforward
- "Nothing Ever Happens" applies strongly here - international condemnation rarely translates to formal UNGA action this quickly

## Calibration Tracking
- 95% confident the answer is No
- Would move toward Yes only if I found evidence of a UNGA vote or emergency special session being convened
