# Meta-Reflection

## Executive Summary
Post ID: 35320. Question asks whether Meta will settle the state AG coalition lawsuit (People of California v Meta Platforms, 4:23-cv-05448) before March 1, 2026. My final forecast is approximately 3% probability. The case is deep in active litigation with no signs of settlement talks, and only ~21 days remain.

## Research Audit
- Exa searches were highly productive, revealing multiple recent articles about the state of the litigation
- CourtListener fetch was blocked (403), but the Exa search captured docket entries from the cached version
- Manifold had no matching markets
- Key sources: lawsuit-information-center.com (excellent timeline), Verge article, CNBC, AP, Bloomberg

## Reasoning Quality Check

*Strongest evidence FOR my forecast (low probability):*
1. No reports of any settlement negotiations between Meta and the AG coalition
2. Active discovery disputes and motions as recently as Sept 2025 indicate parties are far from settlement
3. Meta is actively fighting in every venue (proceeded to trial in LA bellwether, fighting NM AG trial)
4. Federal bellwether trials not until summer/late 2026 - the litigation posture shows no urgency to settle
5. Only 21 days remain - comprehensive settlement with 30+ states requires extensive negotiation
6. Explicit statement from Feb 2026: "no Facebook or Meta lawsuit mental health settlements have been announced yet"

*Strongest argument AGAINST my forecast:*
- Snap and TikTok both settled their portions of related cases, which could create pressure on Meta
- Negative trial outcomes could accelerate settlement talks
- But even if Meta wanted to settle, doing so with 30+ states in 21 days is practically impossible

*Calibration check:*
- This is a predictive question with a very short time horizon
- The "Nothing Ever Happens" principle strongly applies - comprehensive multistate settlements don't materialize in weeks
- Community prediction at 29% seems too high given the evidence. The question was just published today.

## Subagent Decision
Did not use subagents - straightforward enough that direct research was sufficient.

## Tool Effectiveness
- Exa search: very useful, found current litigation status
- WebFetch: blocked by CourtListener (403) - not a critical gap
- Manifold: no matching markets found
- All tools functioned correctly

## Process Feedback
- The research was efficient; multiple parallel searches gave a comprehensive picture
- For litigation questions, legal news sites and court dockets are the best sources

## Calibration Tracking
- 95% CI: [1%, 8%]
- I'm 95% confident this resolves No
- Update triggers: news of settlement talks beginning (+20%), actual trial verdict in bellwether creating massive pressure (+5-10%)
